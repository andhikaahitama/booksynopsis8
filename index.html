Alternative apocalypses can be found in the Zoroastrianism of ancient Persia, in ancient Hindu scriptures and Norse myths. Today, there are an estimated 25 million Christian fundamentalists in the US who believe it will come with the &#39;Rapture&#39;; others point to an ecological catastrophe, the AIDS pandemic or nuclear and biological warfare. What happens when, in the grip of apocalyptic prophesy, individuals and groups see themselves as the &#39;elect&#39; and above conventional mores? As with the Ranters of the English Civil War, it can lead to comedy. But it can also lead to sinister extremism - the Nazis recast it as the Third Reich; latter-day doomsday cults such as the Waco Branch Davidians believed that they too were divinely elected - and could kill in the name of the coming apocalypse. The world today is in the grip of an apocalyptic struggle between the neo-Conservatives in America and a supposed global network of Islamic fundamentalists. For Bush, the war is a &#39;crusade&#39;, for Osama Bin Laden it is a jihad; for both, it is a struggle against absolute evil. From its Biblical beginnings to suicide bombers, via the Vikings, the French Revolution, the Pilgrim Fathers, Hitler&#39;s Apocalyptic rhetoric, asteroids and Hollywood, Pearson shows that as long as human beings seek to make sense of the world in which they live, endings will continue to have a future.</p><p>Simon Pearson&#39;s first-class Oxford degree led to an M Litt on DH Lawrence and the Apocalypse.

In Russia, which was stricken by famine, Lenin had just died, Stalin's dictatorship was in its infancy and the Great Terror had yet to begin. Having taken the first commercial flight to India, which took an astounding seven days, Byron was thrown into the tumultuous last years of the British Raj. Gandhi was imprisoned, while rioting and clashes between Hindus and Muslims had become commonplace. Finally Byron entered Tibet, the forbidden country. Exploring &#x201c;The Land of Snows&#x201d;, he saw Tibet as it was when the then Dalai Lama was still ensconced in the Potala Palace, twenty years before China's invasion. <i>First Russia, Then Tibet</i> is an invaluable first-hand account of transformative moments in periods of change and upheaval.</p></p><p>The great Robert Byron&#39;s classic on 1930s Russia before the world would change forever with WWII in the area.<p>Robert Byron (1905 - 1941)&nbsp;was one of the twentieth century's greatest travel writers as well as a noted art critic and historian. He is the author of the acclaimed <i>The Road to Oxiana, </i>considered by many to be the first example of great travel writing.

His Name is Jesus. On these pages you will be taken by the hand and led to His loving heart. You will discover Jesus as Savior, Sufferer, Servant, Shepherd, Lover, Lord, Healer, Provider, God&#x2014;and so much more. <br> <br> Whether you have known Jesus for years or have never met Him at all, this book will help you fall in love with Him in a life-changing way. You will discover His love, and love Him in return.<br> <br> Says the author, &#x201c;Loving Jesus is the highest calling and the greatest achievement you can ever have.

After the Grand Canyon, Zion Narrows and the Escalante River system, this river basin has more visitors than any other canyon drainage on the Colorado Plateau. If you like narrow canyons, including the single best slot canyon in the world (the Buckskin Gulch), this is the place for you. You can take day-hikes in some of the shorter tributaries, or go on a week-long marathon walk in the lower end of the Paria Canyon.

Written in alternating voices, these sketches, short stories, and poems celebrate the lives of mothers, daughters, grandmothers, sisters, friends, and family spanning continents, generations, languages, religions, and cultures. Home is where the children are born, the food smells of garlic and oregano, the language is loose and round and rolls fluidly from the mouth, and green hillsides are outside kitchen windows. Home is in any kitchen, wherever it is, when the table cloth woven by one grandmother, "dyed by another, embroidered by another still.. [is].. put there in the center every year in memory of our mothers." Home is all the places both have lived; "even Chicago, grim old gritty dust heap of a city had its blues its trains, had its Northern Black Irish Polish Russian Hillbilly Puerto Rican Ojibwe meatpacking railroad citylake city spirit, worthy of love." Home is sadness for the English language when it is "robbed of the beat your home talk could give it, the words you could lend, the accent, the music, the word-order reordering, the grammatical twist." Home is in the hearts from which Rosario and Aurora speak. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Jesse Larsen</i>A mother and daughter of Puerto Rican and Jewish ancestry, the Moraleses express their radical and feminist views in diary-like poetry and prose that echo the rhetoric of the '60s. Yet the mixed origins of this pair lend an international, even universal feeling to the sentiments. They seem to speak for many women of many places and times. Titles of their pieces include "Concepts of Pollution," "Distress Signals," "Getting Out Alive," "Class Poem" and "I Am the Reasonable One." Both authors are literary, serious, socially concerned and passionate, and their anger is about injustices that plague them and other people. There is much vivid imagery and heartfelt emotion, and the reader may well long for causes that stir them as these women are stirred. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Book of Dragons</h2><p>Plagues of dragons swarm England and another eats all the members of a soccer team in this fantastical and fearsome collection of dragon tales for middle readers. Simultaneous.</p><p>She was born in 1858 at 38 Lower Kennington Lane in Kennington, Surrey (now part of Greater London), the daughter of a schoolteacher, John Collis Nesbit, who died in March 1862, before her fourth birthday. Her sister Mary&#39;s ill health meant that the family moved around constantly for some years, living variously in Brighton, Buckinghamshire, France (Dieppe, Rouen, Paris, Tours, Poitiers, Angouleme, Bordeaux, Arcachon, Pau, Bagneres de Bigorre, and Dinan in Brittany), Spain and Germany, before settling for three years at Halstead Hall in Halstead in north-west Kent, a location which later inspired The Railway Children. When Nesbit was 17, the family moved again, this time back to London, living variously in South East London at Eltham, Lewisham, Grove Park and Lee. A follower of William Morris, 19-year-old Nesbit met bank clerk Hubert Bland in 1877. Seven months pregnant, she married Bland on 22 April 1880, though she did not immediately live with him, as Bland initially continued to live with his mother. Their marriage was an open one. Bland also continued an affair with Alice Hoatson which produced two children (Rosamund in 1886 and John in 1899), both of whom Nesbit raised as her own. Her own children were Paul Bland (1880-1940), to whom The Railway Children was dedicated; Iris Bland (1881-19??); and Fabian Bland (1885-1900), who died aged 15 after a tonsil operation, and to whom she dedicated Five Children And It and its sequels, as well as The Story of the Treasure Seekers and its sequels. Nesbit and Bland were among the founders of the Fabian Society (a precursor to the Labour Party) in 1884. Their son Fabian was named after the society. They also jointly edited the Society&#39;s journal Today; Hoatson was the Society&#39;s assistant secretary. Nesbit and Bland also dallied briefly with the Social Democratic Federation, but rejected it as too radical. Nesbit was an active lecturer and prolific writer on socialism during the 1880s. Nesbit also wrote with her husband under the name &#34;Fabian Bland&#34;, though this activity dwindled as her success as a children&#39;s author grew. Nesbit lived from 1899 to 1920 in Well Hall House, Eltham, Kent (now in south-east Greater London). On 20 February 1917, some three years after Bland died, Nesbit married Thomas &#34;the Skipper&#34; Tucker, a ship&#39;s engineer on the Woolwich Ferry.1<br><br>THE BOOK OF BEASTS<br><br>He happened to be building a palace when the news came, and he left all the bricks kicking about the floor for Nurse to clear up--but then the news was rather remarkable news. You see, there was a knock at the front door and voices talking downstairs, and Lionel thought it was the man come to see about the gas which had not been allowed to be lighted since the day when Lionel made a swing by tying his skipping-rope to the gas-bracket.<br><br>And then, quite suddenly, Nurse came in, and said, "Master Lionel, dear, they've come to fetch you to go and be King."<br><br>Then she made haste to change his smock and to wash his face and hands and brush his hair, and all the time she was doing it Lionel kept wriggling and fidgeting and saying, "Oh, don't, Nurse," and, "I'm sure my ears are quite clean," or, "Never mind my hair, it's all right," and "That'll do."<br><br>"You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King," said Nurse.<br><br>The moment Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off without waiting for his clean handkerchief, and in the drawing-room there were two very grave-looking gentlemen in red robes with fur, and gold coronets with velvet sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very expensive jam tarts.<br><br>They bowed low to Lionel, and the gravest one said:<br><br>"Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the King of this country, is dead, and now you have got to come and be King."<br><br>"Yes, please, sir," said Lionel; "when does it begin?"<br><br>"You will be crowned this afternoon," said the grave _gentleman who was not quite so grave-looking as the other.<br><br>"Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would you like me to be fetched, and hadn't I better put on my velvet suit with the lace collar?" said Lionel, who had often been out to tea.<br><br>"Your Nurse will be removed to the palace later. No, never mind about changing your suit; the royal robes will cover all that up."<br><br>The grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses, which was drawn up in front of the house where Lionel lived. It was No. 7, on the left-hand side of the street as you go up.<br><br>Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed Nurse and said:<br><br>"Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let you do the other ear. No--there's no time now. Give me the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse."<br><br>"Good-bye, ducky," said Nurse; "be a good little King now, and say 'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to pass the cake to the little girls, and don't have more than two helpings of anything."<br><br>So off went Lionel to be made King. He had never expected to be a King any more than you have, so it was all quite new to him--so new that he had never even thought of it. And as the coach went through the town he had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because if his tongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming. Half an hour before he had been building with bricks in the nursery; and now--the streets were all fluttering with flags; every window was crowded with people waving handkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet soldiers everywhere along the pavements, and all the bells of all the churches were ringing like mad, and like a great song to the music of their ringing he heard thousands of people shouting, "Long live Lionel! Long live our little King!"<br><br>He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes, but he soon forgot to think about that. If he had been a girl he would very likely have bothered about it the whole time.<br><br>As they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, explained the things which Lionel did not understand.<br><br>"I thought we were a republic," said Lionel. "I'm sure there hasn't been a King for some time."<br><br>"Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened when my grandfather was a little boy," said the Prime Minister, "and since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown--so much a week, you know, according to people's means--sixpence a week from those who have first-rate pocket-money, down to a halfpenny a week from those who haven't so much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be paid for by the people."<br><br>"But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grand-father a crown?"<br><br>"Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books. He was a strange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults--he was fond of books. Almost with his latest breath he sent the crown to be tinned--and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill."<br><br>Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just then the carriage stopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned. Being crowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose, and by the time it was over, and Lionel had worn the royal robes for an hour or two and had had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it, he was quite worn out, and was very glad to get into the palace nursery.<br><br>Nurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and plummy cake, and jam and hot buttered toast, and the prettiest china with red and gold and blue flowers on it, and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked. After tea Lionel said:<br><br>"I think I should like a book. Will you get me one, Nurse?"<br><br>"Bless the child," said Nurse, "you don't suppose you've lost the use of your legs with just being a King? Run along, do, and get your books yourself."<br><br>So Lionel went down into the library. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor were there, and when Lionel came in they bowed very low, and were beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming bothering for now--when Lionel cried out:<br><br>"Oh, what a worldful of books! Are they yours?"<br><br>"They are yours, Your Majesty," answered the Chancellor. "They were the property of the late King, your great-great--"<br><br>"Yes, I know," Lionel interrupted. "Well, I shall read them all. I love to read. I am so glad I learned to read."<br><br>"If I might venture to advise Your Majesty," said the Prime Minister, "I should not read these books. Your great--"<br><br>"Yes?" said Lionel, quickly.<br><br>"He was a very good King--oh, yes, really a very superior King in his way, but he was a little--well, strange."<br><br>"Mad?" asked Lionel, cheerfully.<br><br>"No, no"--both the gentlemen were sincerely shocked. "Not mad; but if I may express it so, he was--er--too clever by half. And I should not like a little King of mine to have anything to do with his books."<br><br>Lionel looked puzzled.<br><br>"The fact is," the Chancellor went on, twisting his red beard in an agitated way, "your great--"<br><br>"Go on," said Lionel.<br><br>"Was called a wizard."<br><br>"But he wasn't?"<br><br>"Of course not--a most worthy King was your great--"<br><br>"I see."<br><br>"But I wouldn't touch his books."<br><br>"Just this one," cried Lionel, laying his hands on the cover of a great brown book that lay on the study table. It had gold patterns on the brown leather, and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists of them, and gold corners, so that the leather should not wear out too quickly.<br><br>"I must look at this one," Lionel said, for on the back in big letters he read: "The Book of Beasts."<br><br>The Chancellor said, "Don't be a silly little King."<br><br>But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he opened the first page, and there was a beautiful butterfly all red, and brown, and yellow, and blue, so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive.<br><br>"There," said Lionel, "isn't that lovely? Why--"<br><br>But as he spoke the beautiful butterfly fluttered its many-colored wings on the yellow old page of the book, and flew up and out of the window.<br><br>"Well!" said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could speak for the lump of wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him, "that's magic, that is."<br><br>But before he had spoken the King had turned the next page, and there was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him. Under him was written, "Blue Bird of Paradise," and while the King gazed enchanted at the charming picture the blue bird fluttered his wings on the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book.<br><br>Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it up on the blank page where the bird had been, and put it on a very high shelf. And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said: <br><br>"You're a naughty, disobedient little King," and was very angry indeed.<br><br>"I don't see that I've done any harm," said Lionel. He hated being shaken, as all the boys do; he would much rather have been slapped.<br><br>"No harm?" said the Chancellor. "Ah--but what do you know about it? That's the question. How do you know what might have been on the next page--a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or something like that."<br><br>"Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you," said Lionel. "Come let's kiss and be friends." So he kissed the Prime Minister, and they settled down for a nice quiet game of noughts and crosses, while the Chancellor went to add up his accounts. <br><br>But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book, and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got The Book of Beasts.<br><br>He took it outside onto the terrace, where the moonlight was as bright as day, and he opened the book, and saw the empty pages with "Butterfly" and "Blue Bird of Paradise" _underneath, and then he turned the next page. There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree, and under it was written "Dragon." The dragon did not move, and the King shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed.<br><br>But the next day he wanted another look, so he got the book out into the garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises, the book opened all by itself at the picture with...</p><h2>The Feng Shui Detective (Feng Shui Detective, 1) (Volume 1)</h2><p><p>Feng Shui master C.F. Wong is no fan of the 21st century. It is far too rushed and noisy, a terrible environment for the kind of peaceful contemplation that his work requires. His clients seem to view him as some sort of general problem-solver, as able to find a missing child as he is to correct the pernicious influences that are bringing bad luck to a business. But there is worse. One of Mr. Wong's clients, a client who cannot be offended, has given Mr. Wong a gift. It comes complete with a never-silent cell-phone, an unfortunate wardrobe, and a grating Australian accent. Mr. Wong has an intern.</p></p><p><p>Nury Vittachi is one of the bestselling English-language authors in Asia. Born in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), he lives in Hong Kong, where he is a popular newspaper columnist. He is the author of more than a dozen books, including four in the &#x201c;Feng Shui Detective&#x201d; series.</p>A bestselling English-language author based in Hong Kong, Vittachi stands to become a lot better known in the U.S. with this soft-boiled mystery peopled by quirky, engaging characters, the first in a new crime series. Set in Singapore and featuring C.F. Wong, a "geomancer" or feng shui master, this lighthearted novel blends, blurs and contrasts the three main ethnic groups of the Asian city-state-Chinese, Malays and Indians. Along with his cohorts, Madame Xu and Dilip Kenneth Sinha (both psychics), the gifted, if often reluctant, detective gets drawn into a plot to save a young girl who has an extraordinarily bleak future, psychically speaking. Wong is dragged to Australia to solve the case by his intern, Joyce McQuinnie, a British-Australian teenager forced on him by a valued client. McQuinnie makes a great foil for his crankiness and obsession with order. The author, unfortunately, sometimes vies for the big laugh with groan-worthy broad humor, usually revolving around someone's accent or lack of understanding of English. Overall, however, his love for Singapore and its distinctive internationalism shines through. Vittachi's unique worldview infuses his writing with vitality and gives his characters a charming believability. American readers should enjoy the virtual vacation this book provides. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And most of all, it is about daring to believe in...Answered Prayers.<br> <br> On the outside, Faith Madison is the very picture of a sophisticated New Yorker. Slim, blond, stylish, Faith has a life many would envy. Overcoming a childhood marked by tragedy, married to a successful investment banker and having raised two grown daughters, Faith has enjoyed her role as mother and wife, and the good life that emanates from their bustling Manhattan town house. But every step of the way, Faith has carried within her a secret she could divulge to no one. And with it, she has kept an even more painful secret from herself.<br> <br> For Faith, it is the sudden death of her stepfather&#x2014;a man who, like her husband, Alex, always remained just beyond her reach&#x2014;that will touch off a journey of change and revelation. At the funeral, painful memories flood back&#x2014;and an old friend reenters Faith&#x2019;s life. Faith is greeting mourners, when she hears a voice behind her and a single word that brings a quick smile to her face: &#x201c;Fred.&#x201d; Only one person aside from her older brother, Jack, called her that. Brad Patterson was Jack&#x2019;s best friend, a long, lanky boy who teased, tormented, and protected Faith when they fancied themselves &#x201c;The Three Musketeers&#x201d; as kids. When Jack died years later, Faith and Brad came together again in their common, inconsolable grief, then lost touch once more amid the demands of families and busy lives a continent apart. <br> <br> Now a lawyer in California, Brad has reentered Faith&#x2019;s life just as she is making a decision that plunges her marriage into crisis. Determined to fulfill a long-held desire for a career of her own, Faith applies to law school against her husband&#x2019;s wishes, igniting a barrage of anger and recrimination. Faith&#x2019;s only solace is the correspondence she has begun with Brad, a man trapped in an empty marriage of his own, a friend she once lost and has found again. Soon e-mails are flying between them, bridging three thousand miles, sharing much-needed friendship, support, laughter. And as these two childhood friends rediscover each other, something extraordinary is beginning to happen. In the safety of their friendship, Brad will find the courage to make a decision he should have made years before. And Faith, too, is changing, beginning to believe in herself&#x2014;and in her right to grab hold of her dreams. Gathering a strength she never knew she had, Faith is finally ready to face the most painful step of all: of sharing the secret that has long been haunting her, and truly opening up her heart for the first time in her life. <br> <br> With unerring insight into the hearts of husbands and wives, lovers and families, Danielle Steel tells a wise and moving story of the secrets that wound and the choices that heal&#x2014;and of the second chances that come only once in a lifetime.</p><p>Danielle Steel has been hailed as one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors, with over 560 million copies of her novels sold.

She was wearing a well-cut black suit, and at forty-seven, she was still as slim as she had been when she married Alex Madison twenty-six years ago. She looked like a Degas ballerina, with her green eyes, and her long straight blond hair, which she had knotted into a sleek bun. She sighed, and sat down quietly in one of the kitchen chairs.<br><br>The small elegant brownstone townhouse on East Seventy-fourth Street in New York was deadly quiet, and she could hear the clock ticking, as she waited for Alex to come home. She closed her eyes for a minute, thinking of where she had been that afternoon. And as she opened them again, she could hear the front door open and close. There was no other sound, no footstep on the hall carpet, no shout of "hello" as he walked in. He always came in that way. He locked the door behind him, set down his briefcase, hung his coat up in the closet, and glanced at his mail. In time, he would come looking for her. He would check her small study, and then glance into the kitchen to see if she was there.<br><br>Alex Madison was fifty-two years old. They had met when she was in college, at Barnard, and he was in business school at Columbia. Things had been different then. He had been enchanted by Faith's open easy ways, her warmth, her energy, her joy. He had always been quiet and reserved, and cautious with his words. They married as soon as she graduated, and he got his MBA. He had been an investment banker ever since. She had worked as a junior editor at Vogue for a year after graduating, and loved it, and then stopped when she went to law school for a year. She dropped out when her first child was born. Eloise had just turned twenty-four and had moved to London in early September. She was working at Christie's, and learning a lot about antiques. Faith's other daughter, Zoe, at eighteen, was a freshman at Brown. After twenty-four years of full-time mothering, Faith had been out of a job for the past two months. The girls were gone--and she and Alex were suddenly alone.<br><br>"Hi, how was it?" Alex asked as he walked into the kitchen looking tired. He barely glanced at her and sat down. He'd been working hard on two IPOs. It didn't even occur to him to touch her or to hug her. Most of the time, he spoke to her from across the room. He didn't do it out of malice, but it had been years since he'd come home from the office and given her a hug. She had no idea when he'd stopped. She'd been so busy with their daughters that she didn't notice, until one day she realized that he didn't touch her when he came home anymore. She was always doing homework with the girls, or bathing one of them, when he came home at night. But it had been a long, long time since he'd been affectionate with her. Longer than either of them knew or cared to remember. There was a chasm between them now that they had both long since accepted, and she felt as though she were looking at him from a great distance as she poured him a glass of wine.<br><br>"It was all right. Sad," she said, as he glanced at the paper, and she took the chicken out of the oven. He preferred fish, but she hadn't had time to buy any on the way home. "He looked so small." She was speaking of her stepfather, Charles Armstrong. He had died two days before, at the age of eighty-four. The rosary had been that day, and the casket had been open so Charles could be "viewed" by family and friends.<br><br>"He was old, Faith. He'd been sick for a long time." As though that not only explained it, but dismissed it. Alex did that. He dismissed things. Just as for years now, he had dismissed her. She felt lately as though she had served her purpose, done her job, and been dispensed with, not only by her children, but by her husband as well. The girls had their own lives now that they'd left home. And Alex lived in a world that didn't include her, except on rare occasions, when he expected her to entertain clients, or go to a dinner party with him. The rest of the time, he expected her to amuse herself. She saw women friends sometimes in the daytime, but most of her old friends still had children at home and were pressed for time. In the past several months, since Zoe left for college, Faith had been spending most of her time alone, trying to figure out what to do with the rest of her life.<br><br>And Alex had a full life of his own. It seemed eons since she and Alex had sat for hours at dinner and chatted about the things that were important to them. It had been years since they had gone for long walks on the weekend, or gone to movies and held hands. She could barely remember what that had been like with Alex. He seldom touched her, and rarely spoke. And yet, she knew he loved her, or at least she thought so, but he seemed to have almost no need to communicate with her. It was all shorthand and staccato words, silence suited him better, as it did now, as she set his dinner down in front of him, and brushed away a stray lock of blond hair. He seemed not to notice her at all, and was engrossed in something he was reading in the paper. It took him a long time to answer when she spoke again.<br><br>"Are you coming tomorrow?" she asked gently. Her stepfather's funeral was the next day. He shook his head as he glanced up at her.<br><br>"I can't. I'm going to Chicago. Meetings with Unipam." He had been having trouble with an important account. Business took precedence over all else, and had for a long time. He had become a very successful man. It had bought them the townhouse, and their daughters' educations, an unexpected amount of ease and luxury that Faith hadn't expected to enjoy. But there were other things that would have meant more to her. Comfort, laughter, warmth. She felt as though she never laughed anymore, and hadn't in a long time, except when she was with the girls. It wasn't that Alex treated her badly. It was more that he didn't treat her at all. He had other things on his mind, and he didn't hesitate to make that clear to her. Even his lengthy silences told her that he would rather think than talk to her.<br><br>"It would be nice if you were there," Faith said cautiously, as she sat down across the table from him. He was a handsome man, and had always been. At fifty-two, he had grown distinguished as well, with a full head of gray hair. He had piercing blue eyes, and an athletic build. One of his partners had died suddenly of a heart attack two years before, and Alex had been careful about diet and exercise since then. Which was why he preferred fish to anything else, and was pushing the chicken she had cooked around his plate. She hadn't had time to be creative. She had been at the funeral parlor with her stepsister, Allison, all afternoon, while people came by to pay their respects. The two women hadn't seen each other since Faith's mother's funeral the year before, and not for ten years before that. Allison hadn't come to her brother Jack's funeral two years before Faith's mother's. There had been too many funerals in recent years. Her mother, Jack, now Charles. Too many people had disappeared. And although she and her stepfather had never been close, she had respected him nonetheless, and it saddened her to think of his being gone. It felt as though all the familiar landmarks were fading from her life.<br><br>"I have to be at the meeting in Chicago tomorrow," Alex said, looking intently into his plate. He was only picking at the chicken, but he hadn't bothered to complain.<br><br>"Other people go to funerals," Faith said quietly. There was nothing strident about Faith. She didn't argue with him, didn't fight. She rarely disagreed with him. There was no point anyway. Alex had a way of removing himself. He did what he wanted, usually without asking or consulting her, and had for years. He operated like a separate entity from her most of the time, and what motivated him was business and the demands it put on him, not what Faith wanted him to do. She knew how he worked and what he thought. It was hard to get behind the walls he put up around himself. She was never entirely sure if it was a defense, or simply what made him comfortable. It had been different when they were young, but it had been this way for years. Being married to him was a lonely place, but she was used to it. She only felt it more now because the girls were gone. They had provided all the warmth she needed for years. It was their absence she felt now, more than his. And she seemed to have drifted away from many of her friends. Time and life and marriage and kids had somehow gotten in the way.<br><br>Zoe had left for Brown two months before. She seemed happy there, and had yet to come home for a weekend, although Providence was close enough. But she was busy with her friends, her life, her activities at school. Just as Eloise was happy in London, with her job. Faith had been feeling for a while that they all had fuller lives than she, and she had been wrestling with trying to decide what to do with her own. She had thought of getting a job, but had no idea what kind of work she could do. It had been twenty-five years since she'd worked at Vogue, before Eloise was born. She had also thought about going back to law school, and had mentioned it to Alex a couple of times. He thought the idea was ridiculous, at her age, and dismissed it out of hand.<br><br>"At your age, Faith? You don't start law school again at forty-seven. You'd be nearly fifty before you graduated and passed the bar." He said it with a look of utter contempt, and although she still thought of it from time to time she didn't mention it to him. Alex thought she should continue doing charity work, as she had for years, and going to lunch with her friends. All of which had begun to seem meaningless to Faith, particularly now with the girls away. She wanted something with more substance to fill her life, but she had yet to find a plan that seemed sensible to her, and one she could convince her husband would be worthwhile.<br><br>"No one is going to miss me at Charles's funeral," Alex said conclusively, as Faith cleared his plate, and offered him some ice cream, which he declined. He was careful about his weight, and was very trim and in good shape. He played squash several times a week, and tennis on weekends, when the weather in New York allowed. They had rented a weekend house in Connecticut when the girls were small, but they hadn't done that in years. Alex liked to be able to go in to the office, if he needed to, on the weekends.<br><br>She wanted to tell him that she would miss him at her stepfather's funeral the next day. But she knew there was no point. Once he made up his mind, one way or another, he could not be swayed. It never occurred to him that she might need him there. And it wasn't the nature of their relationship for her to portray herself that way. She was capable, and well able to take care of herself. She had never leaned heavily on him, even when their children were small. She made good decisions, and was sure of herself. She had been the perfect wife for him. She never "whined," as he put it. And she didn't now. But she was disappointed that he didn't want to be there for her. Disappointment had become a way of life for Faith now. Alex was almost never there when she needed him. He was responsible, respectable, intelligent, provided well for them. And the emotional side of him had vanished into thin air years before. They had wound up with the same relationship his parents had. When she had met them, she had been shocked by how cold they were, and unable to express affection for each other. His father had been particularly remote, just exactly the way Alex had become in time, although Faith had never pointed out to him how similar to his father he was. Alex wasn't demonstrative, and in fact it made him uncomfortable when others were, particularly Zoe and Faith. Their constant displays of affection always made him uneasy, and even more distant and critical of them.<br><br>Of the two girls, Zoe was the most like her, warm, affectionate, good-natured, with a sense of mischief about her, reminiscent of Faith when she was young. She was a terrific student, and a bright girl. But it was Eloise who was closer to her father, they had a kind of silent bond that was more comfortable for him. She was quieter than her sister, and always had been, and like Alex, she was often far more critical of Faith, and outspoken about it. Perhaps because he was. Zoe was always quick to come to her mother's defense, and to stand by her. She had wanted to come to Charles's funeral, although she wasn't close to him. He had never had any real interest in the girls. But as it turned out, she had midterm exams, and couldn't get away. And there was no reason for Eloise to come all the way from London for her step-grandfather's funeral, after he had never given her the time of day. Faith didn't expect it of them, but it would have been nice if Alex could have made the effort to be there.<br><br>Faith didn't mention it to him again. As she did with a lot of other things, she let it go. She knew she wouldn't win the argument. As far as he was concerned, she was perfectly capable of going alone. And he knew, just as his daughters did, that Faith and her stepfather had never been close. His loss was more symbolic to her. And what Faith didn't verbalize to him was that it was more painful because it reminded her acutely of the others who had gone before. Her mother, her brother, Jack, whose death had devastated Faith when his plane went down on the way to Martha's Vineyard three years before. He was forty-six years old at the time, had been an excellent pilot, and the engine had caught fire. The plane had exploded in midair, and it was a shock she had only just recently begun to recover from. She and Jack had always been soulmates and best friends. He had been her sole emotional support, and a source of comfort for her throughout her childhood and adult life. He was always forgiving, never critical, and fiercely loyal. They were two years apart, and growing up, their mother had always said they had been like twins. Particularly when their father died suddenly of a heart attack when Faith was ten and Jack twelve.</p><h2>Dripping With Fear: The Steve Ditko Archives Vol. 5</h2><p>Dripping With Fear: The Steve Ditko Archives Vol. 5 features another 200-plus meticulously restored, full-color pages from Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko in his early prime, at the time working in near anonymity for Charlton Comics in the then-popular horror/suspense genre.

It's not death, however, that leaves a lasting impression but the exuberant life force that emanates from the country and its people.<br>Seeking to understand how extreme danger and passion can coexist in a nation for centuries, Robb travels from the cobalt blue shores of southern Brazil to the arid mountains of the northeast recounting four centuries of Brazilian history from the days of slavery to the recent election of the country's first working-class president. Much more than a journey through history, Robb renders in vivid detail the intoxicating pleasures of the food, music, and climate of the country and references the work of Brazil's greatest writers to depict a culture unlike any other.<br>With a stunning prose style and an endlessly inquisitive intellect, Robb builds layer upon layer of history, culture, and personal reminiscence into a deeply personal, impressionistic portrait of a nation.

Twenty years later only the scar of a small knife wound on my arm reminds me this is a memory and not a dream. The night went on and on like a dream, with a dream's ungraspable logic, or a Brazilian soap's. Details become wonderfully vivid, like the old carving knife with a long curved and darkened blade carelessly left earlier on the kitchen bench of the Copacabana flat, in the moment it was being held at my throat. My Portuguese lost its rudimentary awkwardness and became unreally fluent very fast. Words I never knew that I knew came pouring from my throat. Things flowed with a dream's weightless speed. The danger lay in the speed. A flailing knife blade moves faster than thought. Movement had to be slowed, the heat lowered. It was the one thing I understood. Let nothing happen. Respond to violence, not with violence, speed, and noise, but with ponderous torpidity, envelop each new threat in slowness. The beautiful Portuguese periods began to roll, slowly, slowly, but with what baroque grace, from my amazing tongue.

After all, the war of Watson v. West is as vicious as the Doctor v. Daleks and Browncoats v. Alliance combined, and it goes all the way back to the infamous monkey bars incident in the first grade. Over a decade later, it's time to declare a champion once and for all.<br><br>The war is Trixie's for the winning, until her best friend starts dating Ben's best friend and the two are unceremoniously dumped together and told to play nice. Finding common ground is odious and tooth-pullingly-painful, but Trixie and Ben's cautious truce slowly transforms into a fandom-based tentative friendship. When Trixie's best friend gets expelled for cheating and Trixie cries foul play, however, they have to choose who to believe and which side they're on--and they might not pick the same side.</p><p>LILY ANDERSON is an elementary school librarian and Melvil Dewey fangirl with an ever-growing collection of musical theater tattoos and Harry Potter ephemera.

Goddess of the sixties, reluctant recluse of the seventies, enigmatic icon of the eighties and nineties, she attracted a passionate following that has remained loyal to this day. She crossed the line into soul music, her first love, but never turned her back on pop music. A perfectionist in her work, she was a shy, awkward girl off stage. Misunderstood and misquoted, that was Miss Springfield. She had a lifestyle to envy, was the original &#39;IT&#39; girl and achieved, many believed, the height of decadence. But who really knew her? Who was the real lady behind the black mascara and backcombed hair? This is the story that she never had the chance to tell herself because, nearly two years after her first battle with breast cancer, the disease returned to take her life in 1999.When the end finally came, the music business descended into mourning, tributes flooded in from all over the world, &#34;The Daily Telegraph&#34; front page announced &#39;Dusty Springfield dies on day she was to get OBE&#39; and her Majesty The Queen was reported to be &#39;deeply saddened&#39;. Dusty Springfield was the very heart and soul of British music. Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant, who was responsible for her return to chart success in 1987, believed that &#39;she was the very essence of fabness&#39;.</p><p>SHARON DAVIS was first introduced to Dusty by Martha Reeves, and stayed in touch with her until she died. Their last conversation was about the possibility of a biography, to which Dusty gave her blessing. &#34;Be kind,&#34; were her last words on the subject. Formerly the Motown representative in London, Davis wrote for leading music magazines, and her published books include the official history of Motown, and biographies of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. She also helped Diana Ross research her autobiography.</p><h2>The Other Brother</h2><p>The Other Brother</p><p></p><h2>In Search of the Perfect Meal: A Collection of the Best Food Writing of Roy Andries De Groot</h2><p>Essays describe the author&#39;s childhood, exotic foods, favorite restaurants, secrets of dining, wines and spirits</p><p>Roy Andries de Groot was the author of numerous cookbooks, books and articles about food, and the "gourmet in residence" for the Today show. This book is a collection of his essays, along with a number of his recipes. De Groot's search for the perfect meal led him to place much emphasis on fresh, good quality food. "No amount of cooking skill in the kitchen can produce a fine meal on the table, unless it is preceded by selective skill in the market," he wrote. He enjoyed searching for the perfect meal when dining out, too. His essay "How to Get a Great Meal at a Great Restaurant" is both amusing and full of tips for the knowledgeable diner who is not at the restaurant. A good purchase for public libraries.

It is part of a tradition that dates back at least to the Renaissance, when, spurred on by the great voyagers and navigators, collectors created curio rooms in which fauna, flora, minerals, fossils, skulls, shells, and insects were classified and arranged. Claude Levi-Strauss rightly observed: &#34;A bird, a beetle, a butterfly invite the same rapt contemplation that we reserve for a Tintoretto or a Rembrandt.&#34; In this entomological collection, it is Nature the artist that holds sway, transforming each insect into a work of art.

She had taken a tumble in Peck- ham&nbsp; High&nbsp; Street&nbsp; and&nbsp; was&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; with&nbsp; cuts,&nbsp; bruises&nbsp; and<br>suspected concussion. Two days she lay in A &amp; E, untended, the blood stiffening on her clothes.<br>It made the headlines. TWO&nbsp; DAYS! screamed the tabloids. Two days on a trolley, old, neglected, alone. St. Jude&#x2019;s was be- sieged by reporters, waylaying nurses and shouting into their mo- biles, didn&#x2019;t they know the things were forbidden? Photos showed her lolling gray head and black eye. Plucky pensioner, she had survived the Blitz for this? Her image was beamed around&nbsp; the country:&nbsp; Muriel&nbsp; Donnelly,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latest&nbsp; victim of&nbsp; the&nbsp; collapsing NHS, the latest shocking statistic showing that the British health system, once the best in the world, was disintegrating in a welter of underfunding, staff shortages and collapsing morale.<br>A hand-wringing&nbsp; why-oh-why&nbsp; piece appeared&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Daily Mail, an internal investigation was ordered. Dr. Ravi Kapoor was interviewed. He was weary but polite. He said Mrs. Donnelly had received the appropriate&nbsp; care and that she was waiting for a bed. He didn&#x2019;t mention that he would kill for an hour&#x2019;s sleep. He didn&#x2019;t mention that since the closure of the Casualty department at the neighboring hospital, his own, at St. Jude&#x2019;s, had to cope with twice the number of drunks, drug overdoses and victims of pointless violence; that St. Jude&#x2019;s would soon be closing because its site, in the center of Lewisham, was deemed too valuable for sick people; that the private consortium&nbsp; that had taken it over had sold the land to Safeway, who were planning to build a super- store.<br>Exhausted, Ravi drove home to Dulwich. Walking up his path, he paused to breathe deeply. It was seven in the evening; some- where a bird sang. Beside the path, daffodil blooms had shriveled into tissue paper. Spring had come and gone without his noticing.<br>In the kitchen, Pauline was reading the Evening Standard. The story had gathered momentum;&nbsp; other cases were printed,&nbsp; out- raged relatives told their tales.<br>Ravi opened a carton of apple juice. &#x201c;Thing is, I didn&#x2019;t men- tion the real reason the old bat wasn&#x2019;t treated.&#x201d;<br>Pauline fetched him a glass. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She wouldn&#x2019;t let any darkies touch her.&#x201d;<br>Pauline burst&nbsp; out&nbsp; laughing.&nbsp; At another&nbsp; time&#x2014;another&nbsp; life- time, it seemed&#x2014;Ravi would have laughed too. Nowadays&nbsp; that place was unreachable, a golden land where, refreshed and rested, he could have the energy to find things funny.<br>Upstairs the lavatory flushed.<br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Ravi&#x2019;s head reared up. There was a silence.<br><br>&#x201c;I was going to tell you,&#x201d; said Pauline. &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d;<br>Footsteps creaked overhead.<br>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t be here for long, honestly, not this time,&#x201d; she bab- bled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve told him he&#x2019;s got to behave himself&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d;<br>He knew, of course.<br>Pauline looked at him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my father.&#x201d;<br>Ravi was a man of compassion. He was a doctor; he tended the sick, he mended the broken. Those who were felled by accident, violence or even self-mutilation found in him a grave and reassuring presence. He bandaged up the wounds of those who lay at the wayside, unloved and unlovable; he staunched the bleeding. No- body was turned away, ever. To do the job, of course, required detachment. He had long ago learned a sort of numbed empathy. Bodies were problems to be solved. To heal them he had to vio- late them by invading their privacy, delving into them with his skilled fingers. These people were frightened. They were utterly alone, for sickness is the loneliest place on earth.<br>Work sealed him from the world that delivered him its casual- ties, the doors sighing open and surrendering them up to him; he was suspended from the life to which he would return at the end of his shift. Once home, however, he showered off the hospital smell and became a normal person. Volatile, fastidious, a lover of choral music and computer games, sympathetic enough but somewhat&nbsp; drained.&nbsp; Of&nbsp; course he was compassionate,&nbsp; but&nbsp; no more or less than anybody else. After all, the Hippocratic&nbsp; Oath need not apply on home territory. And especially not to a disgust- ing old sod like Norman.<br>Barely a week had passed and already Ravi wanted to murder his father-in-law. Norman was a retired structural engineer, a monumental&nbsp; bore and a man of repulsive habits. He had been thrown out of his latest residential home for putting his hand up a nurse&#x2019;s skirt. &#x201c;Inappropriate sexual behavior,&#x201d;&nbsp; they called it, though Ravi could not imagine what appropriate&nbsp; behavior could possibly be, where Norman&nbsp; was concerned. His amorous anec- dotes, like a loop of Muzak, reappeared with monotonous regu- larity. Already Ravi had heard, twice this week, the one about catching the clap in Bulawayo. Being a doctor, Ravi was treated to Norman&#x2019;s more risqu� reminiscences in a hoarse whisper.<br>&#x201c;Get me some Viagra, old pal,&#x201d; he said, when Pauline was out of the room. &#x201c;Bet you&#x2019;ve got some upstairs.&#x201d;<br>The man cut his toenails in the lounge! Horrible&nbsp; yellowing shards of rock. Ravi had never liked him, and age had deepened this into loathing of the old goat with his phony regimental tie and stained trousers. Ruthlessly selfish, Norman&nbsp; had neglected his daughter&nbsp; all her life; ten years earlier, however, pancreatic cancer had put his long-suffering wife out of her misery and he had battened on to Pauline. Once, on safari in Kenya, Ravi had watched&nbsp; a warthog&nbsp; muscling its way to a water&nbsp; hole, barging aside any animal that got in its way. He retained, for some rea- son, a vivid image of its mud-caked arse.<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand much more of this,&#x201d; he hissed. Nowadays&nbsp; he and Pauline had to whisper like children. Despite his general di- lapidation, Norman&#x2019;s hearing was surprisingly sharp.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing my best, Ravi, I&#x2019;m seeing another place tomorrow, but it&#x2019;s difficult to find anywhere else to take him. Word gets around, you know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we just send him away somewhere?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes, but where?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;Somewhere far, far away?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ravi, that&#x2019;s not nice. He is my father.&#x201d;<br><br>Ravi looked at his wife. She changed when her father&nbsp; was around. She became more docile, in fact goody-goody, the dutiful daughter&nbsp; anxious&nbsp; that&nbsp; the two&nbsp; men in her life get along. She laughed shrilly at her father&#x2019;s terrible jokes, willing Ravi to join in. There was a glazed artificiality to her.<br>Worse still, with her father in the house he noticed the similar- ity between them. Pauline had her father&#x2019;s square, heavy jaw and small eyes. On him they looked porcine, but one could still see the resemblance.<br>Norman&nbsp; had stayed with them several times during the past year&#x2014;whenever he was kicked out of a residential home, in fact. The stays were lengthening as establishments that hadn&#x2019;t heard of him became harder to find. &#x201c;The man&#x2019;s a menace,&#x201d; said the manager of the last one, &#x201c;straight out of&nbsp; Benny Hill. We lost a lovely girl from Nova Scotia.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thing is, he&#x2019;s frightened of women,&#x201d; said Ravi. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why he has to jump them all the time.&#x201d;<br>Pauline looked at him. &#x201c;At least someone does.&#x201d;<br>There was a silence. They were preparing Sunday lunch. Ravi yanked open the oven door and pulled out the roasting tin.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so tired,&#x201d; he said.<br>It was true. He was always exhausted. He needed time to re- vive himself, to restore himself. He needed a good night&#x2019;s sleep. He needed to lie on the sofa and listen to Mozart&#x2019;s Requiem. Only then could he become a husband again&#x2014;a human being, even. The house was so small, with her father in it. Ravi&#x2019;s body was in a permanent&nbsp; state of tension. Every room he went into, Norman&nbsp; was there. Just at the Lacrimosa he would blunder in, the transistor&nbsp; hanging on a string around&nbsp; his neck burbling the cricket commentary from Sri Lanka.<br>&#x201c;He uses my computer.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t change the subject,&#x201d; said Pauline.<br><br>The place stank of Norman&#x2019;s cigarettes. When they banished him outside, the patio became littered with butts like the Out- patients doorway at St. Jude&#x2019;s.<br>&#x201c;He downloads pornographic sites.&#x201d; When Ravi entered his study the chair was skewed from the desk; the room felt violated. Fag-ends lay drowned in the saucer underneath&nbsp; his maidenhair fern.<br>Pauline slit open a packet of beans. They both knew what they were talking about.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; Ravi stroked her hair. &#x201c;I want to, really. It&#x2019;s just, the walls are so thin.&#x201d;<br>It was true. At night, when they lay in bed, Ravi could almost feel her father a few inches away, lying in the pigsty that had once been the spare bedroom.<br>&#x201c;But he&#x2019;s asleep,&#x201d; said Pauline.<br>&#x201c;Yes, I can hear that, all too distinctly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He is amazing,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never known anybody who can snore and fart at the same time.&#x201d;<br>Ravi laughed. Suddenly they were conspirators.&nbsp; Pauline put the beans on the counter and turned to her husband. Ravi put his arms around her and kissed her&#x2014;truly kissed her, the first time in weeks. Her mouth&nbsp; opened against his; her tongue, pressing against his own, gave him an electric jolt.<br>He pushed his wife against the kitchen unit. She was hot from cooking. He thrust his hand down her slippery cleavage, down beneath her blouse and her stiff butcher&#x2019;s apron. He felt her nip- ple; her legs buckled.<br>&#x201c;Sweetheart,&#x201d; he said. She moved her body against his. He slid his hand into the small of her back to cushion her from the cup- board knobs.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go upstairs,&#x201d; she whispered.<br>There was a sound. They swung round. Norman came in, zip- ping up his trousers.<br><br>&#x201c;Just had the most monumental dump. Must be those chick- peas last night.&#x201d; Norman&nbsp; rubbed his hands. &#x201c;Something smells good.&#x201d;<br>Norman Purse was a vigorous man. Never any problem in that department. His work, building bridges, had taken him all over&#x2014; Malaysia,&nbsp; Nigeria.&nbsp; He had sampled the fleshpots of Bangkok and Ibadan and was proud of his linguistic fluency; in six African languages he could say &#x201c;Show me your pussy.&#x201d; Oh yes, he had plenty of lead in his pencil.<br>His wife, Rosemary, hadn&#x2019;t put up a fuss. She had been a pretty girl once, nicely turned ankles, a bloom to her. That was the trou- ble: she was too bloody nice. There were certain things a chap couldn&#x2019;t do with a well-bred English rose. Besides, she was his wife. After a few years, like all roses, she was past her best. She had grown into a mousy, middle-aged person who cooked his meals and scuttled around doing whatever women did, hardly a peep from her. To be perfectly honest, the woman wasn&#x2019;t a barrel of laughs. The only time he heard her giggle was behind closed doors with their daughter Pauline. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s so funny?&#x201d; he would ask, opening the door. They would jump like rabbits. Then, when he went&nbsp; away,&nbsp; they&nbsp; would&nbsp; start&nbsp; all over again.&nbsp; Women&nbsp; were strange creatures.<br>And now Rosemary was long since dead and his own daughter had become a middle-aged matron herself. Pushing fifty, if he remembered it right. One of these career girls, travel agent, never seen her way to give him a grandchild. But a damn good cook, like her mother, better than that slop at The Beeches. Ravi could rustle up some decent grub too; he said it helped him relax. Nor- man liked teasing his son-in-law. &#x201c;Fancy a takeaway?&#x201d; he would ask, wandering&nbsp; into&nbsp; the kitchen&nbsp; and&nbsp; rubbing&nbsp; his stomach.&nbsp; &#x201c;I could murder an Indian.&#x201d;<br><br>Norman had been living with them for a month now and very comfortable it was, too. He couldn&#x2019;t go back to the bungalow, of course, because it had burned down. All the fault of that damned electrician, what a cowboy. They blamed Norman,&nbsp; said he must have nodded off with a fag in his hand, but that was a lie and a slander. What were they suggesting, that he was losing his mar- bles? He might have a dicky heart&nbsp; and an occasional problem with the waterworks,&nbsp; but at least he had kept his wits unlike some people in the&nbsp; various&nbsp; penal&nbsp; institutions,&nbsp; aka&nbsp; homes,&nbsp; in which he had been incarcerated.&nbsp; Stark raving bonkers, most of them, wandering around in their nighties muttering to them- selves. His daughter had a heart of stone, sending him there. The Dettol-smelling corridors,&nbsp; the tap-tapping&nbsp; of Zimmer walkers, the rows of chairs facing the rain-lashed sea, those ghastly prison wardens who couldn&#x2019;t handle a red-blooded male, the miserable old hags. Lesbians, the lot of them.<br>And they called these places homes. Somebody had a sense of humor. Home was with his daughter in Plender Street. It was her duty to look after her old dad. And it wasn&#x2019;t as if it were a one- way thing. He made himself useful looking after the place when they were at work. Plenty of burglars around, even in Dulwich.<br>It was a gloriously sunny morning in May. Norman filled the saucepan, squirted in some Fairy Liquid and put his hankies on to boil. He was in a good mood. He&#x2019;d had his morning wank, he had emptied his bowels and had thoroughly cleared his nasal passages. What with one thing and another, he got through a lot of handkerchiefs. He had eaten a hearty breakfast&#x2014;Bran Fiber and&nbsp; three slices of&nbsp; toast&nbsp; with&nbsp; Cooper&#x2019;s Old&nbsp; English and&nbsp; that blithering low-cholesterol spread Pauline bought for him. The transistor&nbsp; around&nbsp; his neck&#x2014;he hung it there to keep his hands free&#x2014;burbled the morning news. &#x201c;The pensions time bomb,&#x201d; it said, &#x201c;is a disaster waiting to happen.&#x201d; The water came to the boil; gray scum rose to the surface. &#x201c;Over the next thirty years the elderly population will grow by two-thirds.&#x201d; Norman turned down the gas and let himself out of the house.<br>Plender Street was a pleasant street of Victorian villas&#x2014;quiet; leafy; Neighborhood&nbsp; Watch stickers in the windows. Ravi had done well for himself and Pauline must bring in a few shekels too. twinkies, they called them: Two Incomes and Something or Other.<br>A comely housewife pushed a buggy along the pavement; Norman doffed his hat to her as he walked past. She looked star- tled; good manners were a rarity nowadays, of course. He gazed after her as she quickened her pace; nice arse. Probably wasn&#x2019;t getting much rumpy-pumpy, not with a little kid around. He whistled cheerfully; another thing you didn&#x2019;t hear nowadays, whistling. This place suited him; it was his home, for God&#x2019;s sake. Nice room, meals on tap. No, they weren&#x2019;t going to get rid of him this time. He knew Pauline was searching for another peni- tentiary, she was doing it on the internet, but no luck so far.<br>Norman&nbsp; was having too much fun. Ravi was such a fusspot; he had grown worse with the passing years. Everything had to be just so. Norman&nbsp; knew just how to tease him&#x2014;flicking his fag- ends into the gas-log fire, removing his bottom&nbsp; teeth when he watched TV. He enjoyed his son-in-law&#x2019;s sharp intake of breath. Just that far, no farther. Norman&nbsp; had a well-developed sense of survival.<br>And the man was such a prude.

What Nigel West has discovered is that the most egregious deceptions were in fact the stories themselves. In this remarkable investigation into the claims of many who portrayed themselves as key players in clandestine operations, the author has exposed a catalogue of misrepresentations and falsehoods. <br><br>Did Greville Wynne really exfiltrate a GRU defector from Odessa? Was the frogman Buster Crabb abducted during a mission in Portsmouth Harbor? Did the KGB run a close-guarded training facility, as described by J. Bernard Hutton in School for Spies, which was modeled on a typical town in the American midwest, so agents could be acclimatized to a non-Soviet environment? <br><br>With the help of witnesses with firsthand experience, and recently declassified documents, Nigel West answers these and other fascinating questions from a time when secrecy and suspicion allowed the truth to be concealed.</p><p>NIGEL WEST is an intelligence expert and critically-acclaimed author. Such is his depth of knowledge in these fields that The Sunday Times noted that, 'His information is often so precise that many people believe he is the unofficial historian of the secret services. His books are peppered with deliberate clues to potential front-page stories.&#x2019; In 1989 Nigel was voted 'The Experts' Expert' by The Observer.</p><h2>More Good Old Stuff</h2><p>A collection of fourteen stories, representing MacDonald&#39;s early fiction from the 1940s and 1950s, includes tales of mystery and suspense</p><p>John D. MacDonald was born in Pennsylvania and married Dorothy Prentiss in 1937, graduating from Syracuse University the following year and receiving an MBA from Harvard in 1939. It was Dorothy who was responsible for the publication of his first work, when she submitted a short story that he had sent home while on military service. It was initially rejected by Esquire but went on to be published by Story magazine - and so began MacDonald&#39;s writing career. One of the best-loved and most successful of all the masters of hard-boiled crime and suspense, John D. Macdonald was producing brilliant fiction long after many of his contemporaries had been forgotten, and is still highly regarded today. The Executioners, possibly the best known of his non-series novels, was filmed as Cape Fear in 1962 and 1991, but many of the crime thrillers he produced between 1953 and 1964 are considered masterpieces, and he drew praise from such literary greats as Kurt Vonnegut and Stephen King, who declared him to be &#39;the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller&#39;. His novels are often set in his adopted home of Florida, including those featuring his famous series character Travis McGee, which appeared between 1964 and 1985. He served as president of the Mystery Writers of America and in 1972 was elected a Grand Master, an honour granted only to the greatest crime writers of their generation, including Ross MacDonald, John Le Carre and P. D. James. He won many awards throughout his long career, and was the only mystery writer ever to win the National Book Award, for The Green Ripper.</p><h2>French by Design</h2><p>The enduring appeal of French-country style spans the centuries, a gracious mingling of elegance and ease.

Tour.</p><p>When your marriage fails and life in England gives no solace, the solution, thought Peter Nichols, is to take his beloved boat Toad and sail across the Atlantic to Maine. Nichols, who has spent years sailing small boats but who is far from a wealthy yachtsman, had lovingly restored his 27-foot boat with his former wife. At sea, he reflects upon the busted marriage and upon the odd turns his life has taken. He also engages in some fascinating thoughts detailing the rigors of sailing single-handedly across an ocean. This book is very well written, and as Nichols slowly realizes that Toad has a flaw below the waterline making her less than seaworthy, it turns into a poignant battle for survival on the open ocean.Many people go down to the sea in ships, but few write as movingly of the experience as Peter Nichols does in this enthralling meditation on the wonders of sailing, the mystery of the sea, and the ebb and flow of love.With only a sextant, his instincts as a seasoned sailor, and a boat filled with memories of his floundering marriage, Nichols sets out alone from England headed toward Maine, where he plans to sell his beloved, twenty-seven-foot, engineless boat, Toad. Halfway across the ocean, his boat springs a leak and his voyage becomes a desperate struggle to survive. Filled with clear, luminous prose, Sea Change is a classic tale of a man struggling to come to terms with his reckless spirit, his highest hopes, and his broken dreams.</p><h2>Build, Discover, Survive!

The 70 recipes reflect the traditions of the national cuisine and also showcase the most exciting new tastes from the home cooks and professional chefs who're part of the culinary renaissance in Ireland today. The time-honored fruits of land and sea, such as fluffy potatoes, plump fish, tender meats, and berries bursting with flavor, are interpreted anew in such dishes as Smoked Salmon Chowder, Filet of Baby Beef with Spinach-Bacon Stuffing and Guinness Mustard Sauce, and Raspberry Buttermilk Tarts. Lavish color photographs of the food, the landscapes, and the people are woven through the text, making <i>The New Irish Table</i> the next best thing to sitting down at a table in Ireland itself.</p><p>Margaret M. Johnson writes frequently about food and travel in her ancestral home, including the Irish Heritage Cookbook (0-8118-1992-2). She is an Irish-American in New York.<br><br>Christopher Hirsheimer is executive editor and a cofounder of Saveur. She lives in rural Pennsylvania.Johnson (The Irish Heritage Cookbook) returns once more to her roots and food heritage, this time presenting a volume that showcases the best of the new Irish cuisine and chefs. Based on many time-honored dishes and ingredients, recipes have been updated for the modern palate and more health-conscious diet without losing any of the wonderful flavor of the traditional elements. From the historic mainstay, the potato, used with rosemary and sea salt in the simple yet tasty Accordion Potatoes, and the more time-consuming Blue Cheese Potato Cake with its Eastern Europe influence to the robust Braised Lamb Shanks with Roasted Garden Vegetables, the recipes displays the best foods Ireland has to offer. Traditional dishes include versions of Boxty, the old favorite of both Irish and English alike, Sticky Toffee Pudding, and Black Pudding. Interspersed are wonderful full-color photos that demonstrate the finished dishes, encompass Ireland's green fields and rugged scenery and illustrate the anecdotes and explanations that round out the book. Among these are fascinating insights into Irish Cheese and Wine, Irish Stout and the Kinsale International Gourmet Festival-all of which wonderfully add color and background to this beautifully designed book. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>World of Mushrooms</h2><p>Adapted from the original Italian `funghi&#39; of Uberto Tosco.

Arranged in four parts--alternative paradigms of security, cross-national militarization, militarism in the United States, and pedagogical and cultural concerns--the book critically challenges militarization and voices an alternative encompassing vision of human security by analyzing the relationships among gender, race, and militarization.

However, they are not the final words that La Diva de la Banda had for the world. Those are found in the pages you hold in your hands, Jenni&#x2019;s own account of the highs and lows of her extraordinary journey.<br><br>She became the most acclaimed Spanish-language singer in the United States and sold more than 15 million records worldwide.

In Mexico, she held a sellout performance at the <i>Auditorio Nacional</i> and performed a concert for 80,000 people in Quer�taro. Jenni was also one of the decade&#x2019;s most award-winning artists. In 2009, she earned a record-breaking&nbsp;eleven&nbsp;Billboard Award nominations, becoming the first female regional Mexican performer to be so honored.&nbsp;Unbreakable 1<p></p> Aren&#x2019;t You El Cinco&#x2019;s Lady?<p></p> <br>Ahora estoy, entre luces hermosas<br> <br>mas cuando estaba sola, s� que Dios me cuid�.<br> <br>(Now I am among the beautiful lights,<br> <br>but when I was alone,<br> <br>it was God who took care of me.)<br> <br>&#x2014;from &#x201c;Mariposa de Barrio&#x201d;<br> <br>Sunday, January 26, 1997<br> <br>The night began at El Farallon, a popular nightclub in Lynwood, California. El Farallon was where you went to hang out with your friends and get lost in the music, forgetting everything else for just a few hours. It was where I met Juan L�pez, my second husband, after locking eyes with him across the dance floor. Most important, it was where many regional Mexican singers launched their careers. And it was where I decided to shoot my first music video, for my song &#x201c;La Chacalosa&#x201d; (The Jackal Woman).<br> <br>My father had done business with the owner of El Farallon, Emilio Franco. Franco said we could shoot the video before the doors opened at 9:00 p.m. At the time, my dad, known to many as Don Pedro Rivera, was one of the biggest producers of regional Mexican music. He had always been my biggest supporter, especially in those early days when I was struggling to break out. He had plans to buy commercial airtime for this video to promote &#x201c;La Chacalosa.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t making much money with my music. It was difficult to get my songs on the radio because I refused to fit into the mold of the typical Latina singer. I should have been younger, thinner, softer, quieter, dumber. In the Latino community, female singers were supposed to be beautiful and superskinny, and their music was supposed to be silly. Latina singers were meant to be looked at and not really heard. But I wasn&#x2019;t eye candy. I was considered overweight. I was considered not to have vocal talent. And I was singing strong, ballsy corridos (folk tales, often involving drug dealers). I probably intimidated the men. No other women were singing corridos. It was like a woman rapping. Women weren&#x2019;t thought to be tough enough, or real enough, to be singing about the gritty world of drug dealers. The people in the industry tried to make me change. If you want to make it in this genre, they said, you have to do this or that. A lot of women had to do sexual favors to get played on the radio. Fuck that. I wouldn&#x2019;t do it. I wanted to make it based on my talent or not at all.<br> <br>At the time we shot the video for &#x201c;La Chacalosa,&#x201d; I was working as a Realtor to support my three children and myself. Music was secondary. Juan L�pez, the man I later married, was serving a seven-month prison sentence after being charged with smuggling immigrants. He was set to be released in three weeks. Because I didn&#x2019;t want to be alone, my sister, Rosie, and her friend Gladyz came with me when I would go out at night for a music gig. On this night they sat in the nearly empty club watching me do several takes of the song. I thought we would be done by nine, but by the time we finished taping at around nine thirty, a few customers had started to trickle into the bar area. Before we left I went to the ladies&#x2019; room. As I exited the restroom, a man grabbed my right arm to make sure he had my attention. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you El Cinco&#x2019;s lady?&#x201d; he said. El Cinco (The Five) was Juan L�pez&#x2019;s nickname. I distinctly remember looking into this man&#x2019;s green eyes as he tugged roughly at my arm. He was making me upset and he knew it. &#x201c;Leave me the fuck alone,&#x201d; I told him as I broke away, wondering how he knew Juan and why he cared if I was Juan&#x2019;s lady.<br> <br>I picked up my things and walked out of the club with Rosie and Gladyz. I was in a bit of a rush because they were both still in high school, and this was a school night. I wanted to get them home as quickly as possible so we wouldn&#x2019;t get in trouble and they would be allowed to hang out with me whenever they wanted. I was never one to have many friends, especially since Juan scared many of them away with his temper and his rude behavior. Now that he was incarcerated, I was a loner. Hanging out with the girls was fun and helped keep me busy until his release.<br> <br>First I dropped Gladyz off at her house on Walnut Avenue in North Long Beach, then I dropped Rosie off at our parents&#x2019; house on Ellis Street, just a few blocks away. It was only 10:30, so we were in the clear. Once I made sure Rosie was in the house, I turned up the music and began the drive back home. I was living in beautiful, gangsteriffic Compton. Being a Realtor, I had bought a house there as an investment and decided to live in it for a while. It wasn&#x2019;t the best neighborhood, but I was happy to have a place to call my own. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to get to my bed that night. I was singing along to my all-time favorite CD, 15 �xitos, by Marisela, as I drove down the 91 freeway west.<br> <br>As I exited right onto Central Avenue, I noticed the car behind me flashing its high beams. It got closer and closer as I slowed down to see if I knew who it was. I didn&#x2019;t recognize the small white sports car and I couldn&#x2019;t see who was driving. The driver flashed his high beams again. What the fuck? Was I driving too slow? Did I forget to turn on my signal? Suddenly, the car sped up alongside my green Ford Explorer, purposely trying to sideswipe me. That&#x2019;s when I realized not just one but three men were in the car, and I started to get scared. I sped up, hoping that they were just messing around with me. They weren&#x2019;t. They would drive behind me, then speed up and try to run me off the road and into the parked cars on Central Avenue. &#x201c;Shit. What the hell am I going to do?&#x201d; I said to myself.<br> <br>I was approaching my house on Keene Avenue and didn&#x2019;t want these men to know where I lived. I was living alone with my three young children. Our house had been broken into just two months earlier, and everything had been stolen. That&#x2019;s how the neighbors had found out that my husband was locked up and wasn&#x2019;t there to protect us. All of this was running through my mind as I kept driving around the block, hoping these guys would magically disappear. My whole body was shaking. Finally, I stopped close to my house, though not in front of it. &#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;ll just leave,&#x201d; I kept saying to myself. How foolish.<br> <br>Their car stopped behind me and I could see that the men were ready to step out. I didn&#x2019;t know what to do, and fear took over. I decided that I would make a run for it. I would run as fast as I could, the way my brothers had taught me to when we played baseball as kids.<br> <br>I opened my car door and started sprinting in my high heels, screaming at the top of my lungs. I did not look back. I could hear the sound of their boots running after me. I ran, I screamed louder. I cried. I prayed that someone would hear me. If they did, nobody came to my rescue. The boot steps were gaining on me. My high heels were slowing me down. Suddenly I felt two pairs of strong arms grab me. I had been caught. I tried to fight back. I kicked and screamed. I wasn&#x2019;t going out easy. I was the gangsta bitch from Long Beach. The Rivera rebel who never lost a fight.<br> <br>But I was outnumbered. One man had stayed in the car. One covered my mouth with his huge hand. One dragged me by the hair and pulled at my arms until I was thrown in the backseat of the car. That&#x2019;s when I saw those green eyes again. The prominent chin. The man from the club.<br> <br>He raped me in the backseat of the vehicle. Over and over he repeated the words I had said to him at the club: &#x201c;Leave me the fuck alone. Leave me the fuck alone.&#x201d; He mocked me as he raped me. As the tears streamed down my face, I decided not to fight back anymore. All I could think about was my kids. I was so afraid that I was going to be killed and they would be left without a mother. Maybe the men would let me live if I &#x201c;behaved.&#x201d; I felt that I was losing myself. I could feel the strength seeping out of my body and mind. I was afraid that they were going to take turns on me, but when the man was finished, he told his friend, &#x201c;Throw this bitch out my car.&#x201d; I silently thanked God as I was slammed onto the sidewalk, realizing that it was finally over. But the damage was done.<br> <br>I sat on the curb, numb. I couldn&#x2019;t cry. I was just relieved to be alive.<br> <br>I vowed that I would never tell anyone of my shame. They say that when you keep a secret, it eats you up inside, but I felt that it was better that way. I wanted to appear strong in front of my children and my family. I didn&#x2019;t want anybody to know. And I wanted to maintain my persona as Jenni, the Rivera rebel who had never lost a fight. But deep down inside I knew I had lost a piece of myself that I would never recover. My soul had been shattered, but to the outside world I did just as I had been taught since I was a little girl: I kept my head up and continued forward. It is, after all, the Rivera way.</p><h2>East of the Sun and West Wind (Picturemacs)</h2><p>A young maiden searches for the noble youth whom she loves but who must marry the evil troll princess</p><p>A richly illustrated version of a classic fairy tale.

Pugh's techniques are still in use today, yet he has never enjoyed popular credit for his work.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written by Pugh's daughter, Harriet Tuckey, <i>Everest -- The First Ascent</i> also charts the personal story of her own, and her mother's, relationship with this fiercely independent, troubled, abrasive and eccentric man, as she seeks to uncover the achievements of his controversial career.</p><p>HARRIET TUCKEY is the daughter of Griffith Pugh.

In <i>Refracted Visions</i>, Karen Strassler argues that popular photographic practices such as these have played a crucial role in the making of modern national subjects in postcolonial Java. Contending that photographic genres cultivate distinctive ways of seeing and positioning oneself and others within the affective, ideological, and temporal location of Indonesia, she examines genres ranging from state identification photos to pictures documenting family rituals.<br>Oriented to projects of selfhood, memory, and social affiliation, popular photographs recast national iconographies in an intimate register. They convey the longings of Indonesian national modernity: nostalgia for rural idylls and &#x201c;tradition,&#x201d; desires for the trappings of modernity and affluence, dreams of historical agency, and hopes for political authenticity. Yet photography also brings people into contact with ideas and images that transcend and at times undermine a strictly national frame. Photography&#x2019;s primary practitioners in the postcolonial era have been Chinese Indonesians. Acting as cultural brokers who translate global and colonial imageries into national idioms, these members of a transnational minority have helped shape the visual contours of Indonesian belonging even as their own place within the nation remains tenuous. <i>Refracted Visions</i> illuminates the ways that everyday photographic practices generate visual habits that in turn give rise to political subjects and communities.</p><p>&#34;&#34;Refracted Visions&#34; is a truly brilliant piece of work, beautifully written and characterized by a profound learning and engagement with Indonesian ethnography and a range of debates around visuality and representation. It will be hailed as a classic.&#34;--Christopher Pinney, author of&#34; The Coming of Photography in India&#34;<p>Karen Strassler is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Queens College, City University of New York.</p></p><h2>The Underpants Zoo The Underpants Zoo</h2><p>Briefly speaking -- a hysterical picture book about animals in their underpants! &#34;There&#39;s a new zoo in town, and here&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard . . .

On the shocking discovery of a passenger&#x2019;s body on the Great Western Railway excursion train, Detective Inspector Robert Colbeck and his assistant, Sergeant Victor Leeming, are dispatched to the scene. Faced with what initially appears to be a motiveless murder, Colbeck is intrigued by the murder weapon &#x2013; a noose. When it emerges that the victim had worked as a public executioner, Colbeck realizes that this must be intrinsically linked to the killer's choice of weapon. However, the further he delves into the case, the more mysterious it becomes. When a second man is strangled by a noose on a train, Colbeck knows that he must act quickly; can he catch the murderer before more lives are lost? The memorable characters, first featured in The Railway Detective, again lead you down unexpected paths in their quest to solve the mystery of the noose murders.</p><p>Murder in the midst of merriment can be the most shocking sort, and so it is in the case of Jacob Bransby--brutally strangled with a length of wire while on board a train carriage crowded with lowlife Londoners, all bound for an illegal bare-knuckle prizefight in Berkshire in 1852. That the deceased's wallet was not purloined leaves Scotland Yard Inspector Robert Colbeck wondering at the motive for this heinous act--and, soon, additional crimes--in <i>The Excursion Train</i>, Edward Marston's second witty, railroad-tied Colbeck escapade (after <i>The Railway Detective</i>).<p> </p><p> It doesn't take the foppish flatfoot long, though, to realize that "Bransby" was an alias, behind which hid a veteran public executioner, notorious both for his religious mania and his appalling incompetence with a hangman's noose. While the deceased's suffering spouse lives in denial of her husband's invidious deeds and macabre mementos, and their estranged son operates under his wife's maiden name in order to avoid being treated "as if I was a leper," Colbeck--assisted, as usual, by tenacious Sergeant Victor Leeming--does everything he can to expose the dead man's secrets, and thus flush out a killer. Could this homicide have been committed in retribution for the botched hanging in Kent, a month before, of butcher Nathan Hawkshaw, a generally upstanding individual convicted (despite his protestations of innocence) of hacking to death the alleged rapist of his 16-year-old stepdaughter, Emily? The inspector can only determine that, it seems, by first revisiting the Hawkshaw case--an endeavor that will lead to Leeming's inauspicious beating, an attempted suicide, Colbeck's employment of Madeleine Andrews (the comely conductor's daughter he rescued in <i>The Railway Detective</i>) as his investigative confederate, and yet another slaying on the tracks.</p><p> </p><p> Brimming with whimsical dialogue, full-throttle turns, and a droll cast (especially delightful is priggish police superintendent Edward Tallis), <i>The Excursion Train</i> might only be faulted for the artlessness of its romantic subplot. British novelist Marston, best known for his Elizabethan theater mysteries (<i>The Counterfeit Crank</i>), has struck a rich, arcane vein of possibilities by rooting the Colbeck books in the world of railroads--the transformational technology of mid-19th-century England. Colbeck and Leeming have the opportunity in future installments to steam off after malefactors in any queer corner of Victorian Britain. All aboard! --<i>J. Kingston Pierce</i></p>Edward Marston has written over a hundred books, including some non fiction. He is best known for his hugely successful Railway Detective series. His other current series are the Home Front Detective , set in the Great War, and the Bow Street Rivals, featuring identical twin detectives during the Regency.</p><h2>Voyagers to the West: A Passage in the Peopling of America on the Eve of the Revolution</h2><p><b>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the Saloutos Prize of the Immigration History Society</b><br><br>Bailyn's Pulitzer Prize-winning book uses an emigration roster that lists every person officially known to have left Britain for America from December 1773 to March 1776 to reconstruct the lives and motives of those who emigrated to the New World.<br><br>"<i>Voyagers to the West</i>&nbsp;is a superb book. . . .

Meanwhile, Jeremiah must learn to deal with his new faith and his new love--while risking everything to save his nephew from enemies.</p><p>This second book in the historical romance series begun with Mercy and Eagleflight (Tyndale, 1996) follows the young couple and their friends as they help settle the West. Jeremiah Eagleflight hopes to marry Mercy, but their plans are interrupted by his nephew Jess and his attempts to find a hidden cache of sapphires, the loot from an old robbery. Action takes a backseat to discussions of religious belief, so some Western fans may be a bit disappointed.

While in his early `20s, he and his family were sent to a succession of Nazi concentration camps. He recounts the horror of this time, the struggle to survive, and the efforts to help one another. He argues that 18 things kept him alive, 18 being the numeric value for the Hebrew word for "life." Among these links are the more commonplace, such as his good health before being incarcerated; his youth; and his profession of trained furniture maker, which occasionally helped him to secure less punishing work assignments. Others, however, are more remarkable, like the encounter with a foreman at a work site where Oertelt was working before being sent to the camps. This man, an assumed Nazi supporter, alerted the Jews on his crew to leave the site one day when the Nazis arrived, thereby giving them the chance to escape capture, if only for a little while. Written with a good deal of emotion, the book is very affecting. A solid choice for Holocaust-memoir collections.-Carol Faz-ioli, formerly at The Brearley School, New York City</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Gr. 9^-up. Oertelt, who lived with his older brother and widowed mother in Berlin, had just marked his twelfth birthday when Hitler came to power in January 1933. He begins with a firsthand account of Kristallnacht (November 9^-10, 1938), when the Nazis destroyed Jewish property and synagogues across Germany and Austria, and he recounts the many anti-Jewish directives that followed. Oertelt divides the book into 18 "links" in the chain of events that kept him alive. They include a Nazi foreman who warned him of an impending Gestapo roundup of Jews, giving him time to flee; a 15-month confinement in Theresienstadt concentration camp, where the chance of survival was somewhat better than at Auschwitz; and the fact that he remained in relatively good health and received medical treatment from an SS general-doctor when he did become ill. The two brothers survived, but their mother and most of their relatives were murdered. This is an extraordinary memoir of one brave individual's travail during the Holocaust. <i>George Cohen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She explores the influences of John Wayne and Howard Hughes, and offers ruminations on the nature of good and evil in a Death Valley motel room. Taking its title from W. B.

Her unblinking vision and deadpan tone have influenced subsequent generations of reporters and essayists, changing our expectations of style, voice, and the artistic possibilities of nonfiction. <br>"In her portraits of people," "The New York Times Book Review wrote, "Didion is not out to expose but to understand, and she shows us actors and millionaires, doomed brides and naive acid-trippers, left-wing ideologues and snobs of the Hawaiian aristocracy in a way that makes them neither villainous nor glamorous, but alive and botched and often mournfully beautiful. . . . A rare display of some of the best prose written today in this country." <br>In essay after essay, Didion captures the dislocation of the 1960s, the disorientation of a country shredding itself apart with social change. Her essays not only describe the subject at hand--the murderous housewife, the little girl trailing the rock group, the millionaire bunkered in his mansion--but also offer a broader vision of America, one that is both terrifying and tender, ominous and uniquely her own. <br>Joyce Carol Oates has written, "Joan Didion is one of the very few writers of our time who approaches her terrible subject with absolute seriousness, with fear and humility and awe. Her powerful irony is often sorrowful rather than clever. . . . She has been an articulate witness to the most stubborn and intractable truths of our time, a memorable voice, partly eulogistic, partly despairing; always in control.""A slant vision that is arresting and unique . . . Didion might be an observer from another planet--one so edgy and alert that she ends up knowing more about our own world than we know ourselves."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Anne Tyler<br><br>"The story between the lines of Slouching Towards Bethlehem is surely not so much 'California' as it is [Didion's] ability to make us share her passionate sense of it."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Alfred Kazin<br></p><h2>The Dangers of Socialized Medicine</h2><p>This book exposes the dangers that Americans face with the prospect of socialized medicine.

I basked in the morning sun, drinking in the rich, late-summer air and the perfect view of the crystal-clear lake, the distant snow-capped mountains, the endless evergreens.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Serena swam to the middle of the lake, I squinted over at the path, looking for a familiar blond head. Daniel was supposed to join us.<br>&nbsp;<br>Daniel and I had been friends since I&#x2019;d moved to Salmon Creek when I was five. Then, last year, there&#x2019;d been a school dance where the girls were supposed to invite the guys, and Serena thought we should draw straws to see who asked Daniel. I liked him, but not the way Serena did, so I&#x2019;d fixed the game so she&#x2019;d win. They&#x2019;d been together ever since.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Serena swam back toward me, I stripped to my bra and panties, dropping my clothes into the bushes below.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ooh la la,&#x201d; she called. &#x201c;Check out the new undies. Did some amazing friend finally take pity and buy you grown-up stuff?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, and she&#x2019;d better be right about them not going seethrough when they get wet. Otherwise her boyfriend is going to see a lot more of me than she&#x2019;d like.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Serena laughed. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be fine. White&#x2019;s your color. Shows off your tan.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I shook my head at her and plaited my long black hair. I don&#x2019;t have a tan. I&#x2019;m Native. Navajo, maybe. I&#x2019;d been adopted as a baby and my mother hadn&#x2019;t been around to fill in any background forms.<br>&nbsp;<br>I climbed farther up the rocks and stopped at one overhanging the lake.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I balanced there, Serena called, &#x201c;Hey, those low riders show off your birthmark. Did you ask your parents about getting that tattoo?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My fingers dropped to the mark on my hip. It looked like a faded paw print, and I wanted to get it tattooed so it would show up better.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Mom says maybe when I&#x2019;m sixteen. Dad says when I&#x2019;m sixty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll come around.&#x201d; She flipped onto her back and floated. &#x201c;He always does. You should do it for your sixteenth birthday next year. We&#x2019;ll get your mom to take us over to Vancouver, make a weekend of it. I&#x2019;ll get one, too. I want a nightingale, right over my boob, so when I get up on stage in my sexy dress, cut down to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She flailed suddenly. &#x201c;Maya!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She went under. Disappeared completely, like a hook had dragged her down.<br>&nbsp;<br>I jumped into the water, and I hit it wrong. Pain smacked me so hard I gasped. Water filled my mouth and my nose. I swam out in a frantic dog paddle. I could see the rings where Serena had gone under. They seemed to get farther away with every clumsy stroke I took.<br>&nbsp;<br>I treaded water, looking around. &#x201c;Serena?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>No answer.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;If this is a prank to get me in the lake, it worked,&#x201d; I said, my voice quavering.<br>&nbsp;<br>When she didn&#x2019;t reply, I dove. As I went under, panic hit, like it always did&#x2014;my gut telling me this was wrong, dangerous, get above the surface or I&#x2019;d drown.<br>&nbsp;<br>The normally clear lake was brown, churned up dirt swirling through it, and I couldn&#x2019;t see.<br>&nbsp;<br>I shot up from the water.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Help!&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;Someone! Please!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I dove again, blind and flailing, praying my hand or foot would brush Serena.<br>&nbsp;<br>She&#x2019;s been under too long.<br>&nbsp;<br>No, she hadn&#x2019;t. Serena could hold her breath forever. Last year, we&#x2019;d timed her at a swim meet and she&#x2019;d stayed under for five minutes before the coach ran over and made her stop. I couldn&#x2019;t hold my breath even for a minute. I bobbed up again, gasping.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Maya!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I followed the shout to the shore. The sun glinted off the wet rocks and I blinked. Then I glimpsed blond wavy hair and a flash of tanned skin as Daniel yanked off his shirt.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Serena,&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;She went und&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My kicking leg caught on something. I tried to pull, but it tightened around my ankle. I went under, screaming. Water filled my mouth as it closed over my head.<br>&nbsp;<br>I fought, kicking and twisting, trying to grab at whatever had me. My fingers brushed something soft, and my brain screamed &#x201c;Serena!&#x201d; I tried to grab her, but I was dragged deeper and deeper until my feet hit the bottom. Then, whatever was wrapped around my ankle fell away.<br>&nbsp;<br>I pushed up through the murky water. But as soon as my feet left the lake bottom, I couldn&#x2019;t tell where the surface was anymore. Everything was dark. My lungs burned. My head throbbed. I kept fighting my way up. Oh God, let it be up. Finally I broke through. I felt the sunlight and the slap of cool air, only to go back down again. I pushed up, but couldn&#x2019;t stay afloat, couldn&#x2019;t seem to remember how to tread water. My whole body ached. Staying above was such a struggle, it was almost a relief when the water closed over my head again, peaceful silence enveloping me.<br>&nbsp;<br>I had to struggle not to give in, had to force my arms and legs to keep churning, get my head back above&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;<br>Arms grabbed me. They seemed to be pulling me under and I struggled against them.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Maya!&#x201d; Daniel shouted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I didn&#x2019;t care. I needed him to let go of me, leave me be, let me breathe. He gripped me tighter, wrapping one strong arm around me as he swam.<br>&nbsp;<br>I told Daniel to let me go, that I could make it to shore, just find Serena, please find Serena. He thought I was still panicking and kept hauling me along until, finally, he heaved me onto the rocks.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Serena,&#x201d; I gasped. &#x201c;Get Serena.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He hoisted himself up and scanned the shore and I realized he hadn&#x2019;t understood. Oh God, he hadn&#x2019;t heard me.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Serena!&#x201d; I yelled. &#x201c;She went under. I was trying to find her.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>His eyes widened. He twisted and plunged into the lake. I huddled there on a rock, coughing, as he swam out. I watched him dive and come back up. Dive and come back up. Dive and come back up . . .<br>&nbsp;<br>They dragged the lake that afternoon and found Serena&#x2019;s body. Her death was ruled an accidental drowning. A healthy teenage girl, captain of the swim team, had drowned. No one knew how it happened. An undertow. A cramp. A freak panic attack. There were plenty of guesses but no answers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Soon all that was left of Serena was a monument in the school yard. The town moved on. I didn&#x2019;t. Something had happened in that lake, something I couldn&#x2019;t explain. But I would. One day, I would.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Ground: A Reprise of Photographs from the Farm Security Administration</h2><p><p>In <i>Ground</i>, Bill McDowell has assembled a series of "killed" negatives from the FSA archives, many of which have never before been published. These include several photographs from 1936 that Walker Evans had made for <i>Let Us Know Praise Famous Men</i>, the book he published with James Agee. Also included are never before published photographs by Walker Evans, Russell Lee, Ben Shahn, Marion Post Wolcott, John Vachon, Paul Carter, Theodor Jung, Carl Mydans, and Arthur Rothstein.</p><p></p><p></p><p>McDowell has poetically organized the photographs in <i>Ground</i> according to how and what they represent. While the book's images document 1930s agriculture and landscapes, they also have been chosen for the manner in which their black hole (created by Roy Stryker's hole punch) abstracts its subjects. McDowell feels that in today's culture the "killed" negatives' black hole has the appearance of being a contemporary mark, one current with the practice of intervention, alteration, and appropriation. This provides the photographs a temporal duality in which they present the post-Depression era through a contemporary filter. In our continuing struggle to recover from 2008's Great Recession, these photographs speak to now even as they confer on past government programs, race and class, damaged and bountiful land, drought, flood, and exodus.<br><br><b>Bill McDowell</b> is the 2013 recipient of the Peter S.

Debuting in 1956, the popular 87th Precinct series is one of the longest running crime series ever published, featuring more than 50 novels, and is hailed as "one of the great literary accomplishments of the last half-century." McBain was awarded the Grand Master Award for lifetime achievement in 1986 by the Mystery Writers of America and was the first American to receive the Cartier Diamond Dagger award from the Crime Writers Association of Great Britain.<p><b>Chapter One</b><br> </p><p> It could have been 1937. </p><p> It might have looked like this on a night in late June, the sidewalks washed with a light drizzle, the asphalt glistening slickly, blackly, in the splash of red and green neons. Despite the drizzle, there would be a balmy touch to the air, the fragrant smell of June, the delicate aroma of bursting greenery. And the perfume of growing things would mingle with the perfume of passing women, mingle with the perfume of people and machines, mingle with the ever-present smell of the city at night. </p><p> The clothes would have looked different, the women's skirts a little shorter, the men's coats sporting small black-velvet collars, perhaps. The automobiles would have been square and black. The shop windows would have carried the blue eagle of the National Recovery Act. There would have been small differences, but a city does not really change much over the years, because a city is only a collection of people and people are timeless. And the way the automobile came around the corner, it could have been 1937. </p><p> The man walking on the sidewalk didn't even look up when the sedan squealed around the corner. He was city-born and city-bred, and the sound of shrieking tires was not an alien sound to him. He walked with nonchalant arrogance, this man, dressed in expensive good taste. He walked with the sure knowledge that all was right with the world, the certainty that he was master of all he surveyed. The automobile squealed around the corner and headed directly for the curb. It pulled up about ten feet ahead of the walking man. The windows on the side facing the curb were open. The engine idled. </p><p> The muzzle of a rifle appeared at one of the windows. The man walking broke his stride for just an instant. The person about to fire the rifle was looking through a telescopic sight down the length of the barrel. The distance between the muzzle's end and the walking man was no more than eight feet. There was a sudden blurring flash of yellow, and then a shockingly loud explosion. The man's face erupted in flying fragments; the rifle was pulled back from the window. There was a moment, and then the car gunned away from the curb, tires burning rubber, shrieking into the night. The man on the sidewalk lay bleeding profusely, and the drizzle softly covered him like a shroud. </p><p> It could have been 1937. </p><p> But it wasn't.<br> </p><p> A pair of green globes straddled the entrance doorway to the precinct. For the benefit of those who might have missed one or another of the globes, the numerals 87 were lettered onto both in black paint. Seven gray stone steps led from the sidewalk to the entrance doorway. Just inside the doorway, the desk sergeant sat behind the high desk, looking like a defrocked magistrate. A sign on the desk warned all visitors that they must stop there before proceeding further. Just beyond the desk and opposite it, a rectangle of wood that had been shaped into a pointing hand and then painted white announced, detective division. The pointing hand indicated a double flight of metal stairs that led to the second floor of the precinct building. The locker room was at one end of the corridor on the second floor. The detective squadroom was at the other end, separated from the corridor by a slatted rail divider. Between the locker room and the squadroom, there were two benches, the clerical office, the men's lavatory, and a room marked interrogation. </p><p> The squadroom behind the slatted rail divider was sometimes called the "Bull Pen" by the uniformed cops of the precinct. The title was delivered with affectionate envy, for it was here that the detectives, the �&#x201a;lite, the bulls of the 87th, conducted their business. </p><p> On the morning of June twenty-seventh, Detective Bert Kling's business was with a man named Mario Torr. </p><p> Torr had come to the station house of his own volition, had mounted the seven gray stone steps, stopped at the desk as requested, asked for the detectives, and been directed to the pointing hand opposite the desk. He had climbed to the second floor of the building, entered the dimly lighted corridor there, hesitated a moment, and then walked to the end of the corridor, where he'd waited outside the railing until one of the detectives had asked him what he wanted. Torr was dressed in ready-to-wear mediocrity. There are men who can make a thirty-five-dollar suit look as if it were handtailored. Torr was not one of these men. He wore his brown sharkskin as if it belonged to his fatter brother. His tie had been picked up in a three-for-a-dollar tie shop along The Stem. His white shirt had been laundered too often. The cuffs and collar were frayed. </p><p> There was, in fact, a frayed appearance to the entire man who was Mario Torr. He needed a haircut, and he had not shaved too closely that morning, and his teeth did not look very white or very clean. Worse, he looked as if he knew he was not dapper. He looked as if he had wilted and didn't know how the hell to unwilt. </p><p> He sat opposite Kling at one of the desks, and his eyes blinked nervously. He was apparently not too comfortable inside a police precinct, and even less comfortable talking to a detective in a squadroom. He spoke to Kling with the hesitant, distrustful sincerity of a disbeliever on a psychiatrist's couch for the first time. All the while, his eyes blinked and his hands picked imaginary lint from the too clean, spotlessly mediocre, brown sharkskin suit. </p><p> "You know his name was Sy Kramer, huh?" Torr asked. </p><p> "Yes," Kling said. "We got a positive identification from his fingerprints." </p><p> "Sure. I figured you already knew that." </p><p> "Besides, he was carrying a wallet with identification. And five hundred dollars in cash." </p><p> Torr nodded reflectively. "Yeah, he was a big spender, Sy was." </p><p> "He was a blackmailer," Kling said flatly. </p><p> "Oh, you know that, too, huh?" </p><p> "I told you we identified him from his prints, didn't I?" </p><p> "Mmm," Torr said. "Tell me something." </p><p> "What would you like to know?" </p><p> "You figure this for a gang kill?" </p><p> "It looks that way," Kling said. </p><p> "Does that mean you'll just let it drop?" </p><p> "Hell, no. Murder is murder." </p><p> "But you're starting with gang stuff, huh?" </p><p> "We've got a few feelers out," Kling said. "Why? Are you selling information, Torr? Is that why you're here?" </p><p> "Me?" Torr looked seriously offended. "Do I look like a stoolie?" </p><p> "I don't know what you look like. Why are you here?" </p><p> "Sy was a friend of mine." </p><p> "A close friend?" </p><p> "Well, we shot a game of pool together every now and then. Who'll be working on this case?" </p><p> "Detectives Carella and Hawes caught the squeal. It's their case. The rest of us'll help if we're needed. You still haven't told me why you're here, Torr." </p><p> "Well, I don't think this was a gang kill. The papers said a hunting rifle got him. Is that right?" </p><p> "According to Ballistics, it was a .300 Savage, yes." </p><p> "Does that sound like a gang kill? Listen, I asked around. Nobody had anything against Sy. There was no beef. How could there be? He was a loner. He never got involved with any of the racket boys. Blackmail you do alone. The more people who know, the more ways you've got to split." </p><p> "You seem to know a lot about it," Kling said. </p><p> "Well, I get around." </p><p> "Sure." </p><p> "So it's my idea that one of Sy's marks -- you know, somebody he was giving the squeeze -- decided it was time to get rid of him. That's my idea." </p><p> "Would you happen to know who his marks were?" </p><p> "No. But they must've been big. Sy always had plenty of money. A big spender he was, Sy." Torr paused. "Do you? Know who the marks were, I mean?" </p><p> "No," Kling said, "but of course we'll look into it. I still don't know why you're so interested, Torr." </p><p> "He was my friend," Torr said simply. "I want to see justice done." </p><p> "You can rest assured we'll do everything in our power," Kling said. </p><p> "Thanks," Torr said. "It's just cause he was my friend, you understand. And I think you're taking the wrong approach with this 'Gangland Murder' garbage the newspapers are printing." </p><p> "We have no control over the press, Mr. Torr," Kling said. </p><p> "Sure, but I wanted you to know what I thought. Cause he was my friend, Sy was." </p><p> "We'll look into it," Kling said. "Thanks for coming up."<br> </p><p> The first thing Kling did when Torr left the squadroom was to call the Bureau of Criminal Identification. </p><p> The bureau was located at Headquarters, downtown on High Street. It was open twenty-four hours a day, and its sole reason for existence was the collection, compilation, and cataloguing of any and all information descriptive of criminals. The I.B. maintained a Fingerprint File, a Criminal Index File, a Degenerate File, a Parolee File, a Released Prisoner File, a Known Gamblers, Known Rapists, Known Burglars, Known Muggers, Known Any-and-All Kinds of Criminal File. Its Modus Operandi File contained more than 80,000 photographs of known criminals. And since all persons charged with and convicted of a crime were photographed and fingerprinted, as specified by law, the file was continually growing and continually being brought up to date. The I.B. received and classified some 206,000 sets of prints yearly, and it answered requests for some 250,000 criminal records from police departments all over the country. When Kling asked for whatever they had on a man named Mario Torr, the I.B. dug into its files and sent Kling the photostated tickets before noon. </p><p> Kling was not at all interested in the fingerprints that were in the envelope. He scanned them rapidly, and then picked up the copy of Mario Torr's sheet.<br> </p><p> There was in the Penal Law a subtle distinction between extortion and blackmail. </p><p> Section 850 defined extortion as "the obtaining of property from another, or the obtaining the property of a corporation from an officer, agent or employee thereof, with the consent, induced by a wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right." </p><p> Section 851 picked up where 850 left off, with a definition of what threats may constitute extortion: "Fear, such as will constitute extortion may be induced by an oral or written threat: 1. To...," etc., etc. The subdivision utilized in the charge against Torr had been subdivision 4: "...oral or written threat: 4. To expose any secret affecting him or any of them." </p><p> Such was the nature of extortion. </p><p> Blackmail was extortion in writing. </p><p> Section 856 of the Penal Law stated that "A person who...causes to be forwarded or received...any letter or writing, threatening: 1. To accuse...2. To do any injury...3. To publish or connive at publishing any libel...4. To expose...," etc., is guilty of blackmail. </p><p> The distinction was indeed a subtle one in that blackmail had to be in writing, whereas extortion could be either oral or written. In any case, Torr was both a convicted extortionist and an accused blackmailer. </p><p> Kling shrugged and looked through the rest of the photostated material in the I.B.'s packet. Torr had served a year at Castleview, the state's -- and possibly the nation's -- worst penitentiary. He had been released on parole at the end of that time, after receiving a guarantee of employment from a construction company out on Sand's Spit. He had in no way violated his parole. Nor had he been arrested again since his prison term had ended. He was, at present, still gainfully employed by the same Sand's Spit construction company, earning good wages as a laborer. </p><p> He seemed to be a decent, upright, honest citizen. </p><p> And yet he was interested in the apparent gangland murder of a known blackmailer. </p><p> And Bert Kling wondered why. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 1958 by Ed McBain.

People were rushing to make up for lost time, grasping for material wealth. This was the era of &#34;total electric living,&#34; a phrase beamed into living rooms by General Electric spokesman Ronald Reagan. Environmental awareness was barely a gleam in the eye of even Rachel Carson.And yet, Helen and Scott Nearing were on a totally different path, having left the city for the country, eschewing materialistic society in a quest for the self-sufficiency they deemed &#34;the Good Life.&#34; Chelsea Green is pleased to honor their example by publishing a new edition of &#34;The Maple Sugar Book,&#34; complete with a new section of never-before-published photos of the Nearings working on the sugaring operation, and an essay by Greg Joly relating the story behind the book and placing the Nearings&#39; work in the context of their neighborhood and today&#39;s maple industry.Maple sugaring was an important source of cash for the Nearings, as it continues to be for many New England farmers today.

It concerns, as James Jesus Angleton described it to the author, " a state of mind &#x2014;and the mind of the state." With a new Preface (2014) Praise For Edward Jay Epstein &#x201c;Epstein delves deep into the wheels-within-wheels of superpower intelligence and counterintelligence, showing ways in which the CIA and the KGB have been "provoked, seduced, lured into false trails, blinded, and turned into unwitting agents." Readers will find new information here on a multitude of subjects: programs involving CIA-written books published under defectors' names; the story of Yuri Nosenko, a KGB officer who defected in 1963 and was "at the heart of everything that happened at the CIA for a decade"; and the theories of James Angleton, the former CIA chief of counterintelligence, on the hidden motives of KGB super-mole Kim Philby.

Teachers are eager for the chance to learn the Monart Drawing Method, a practical, field-tested technique that assumes no prior knowledge of art or special talent.<br>Mona developed the Monart Drawing Method after she observed what she felt was a state of visual illiteracy among children. She was shocked that even very young children were suffering from competitive and judgmental attitudes to the point of being unwilling to try, for fear of failure. Although she recognized the need for the symbolic representations that all children draw naturally, she noted that they did not know where to begin to draw the realistic illustrations they yearned to create.<br>From this grew the Monart Drawing Method, which features a noncompetitive environment where children are free to explore independent expression while simultaneously learning how to observe all visual data through five basic elements of shape. The Method has instilled a sense of pride among the thousands of students who have overcome the "I can't draw" mindset and learned to create remarkable artwork.<br>This latest edition of Drawing with Children includes a new sixteen-page full-color insert, hundreds of new illustrations, and two additional chapters explaining how to reach children with learning problems and how to incorporate drawing into teaching the basic subjects in an integrated school curriculum.</p><p>Mona Brookes is founder of the Monart Drawing Schools.</p><h2>Even If i Did Something Awful</h2><p>Before revealing the awful thing she did, a child tries to get her mother&#39;s assurance of love, no matter what.</p><p></p><h2>Rough Rider &amp; Matchmaking with a Mission: An Anthology (Harlequin Intrigue: Whitehorse, Montana: The McGraw Kidnapping)</h2><p><strong>New York Times</strong><strong> bestselling author B.J.

The miracle soon attracted Indian pilgrims from pueblos throughout the highlands of Chiapas. When alarmed Spanish authorities stepped in to put a stop to the burgeoning cult, they ignited a full-scale rebellion. Declaring "Now there is no God or King," rebel leaders raised an army of some five thousand "soldiers of the Virgin" to defend their new faith and cast off colonial rule.Using the trial records of Mayas imprisoned after the rebellion, as well as the letters of Dominican priests, the local bishop, and Spaniards who led the army of pacification, Kevin Gosner reconstructs the history of the Tzeltal Revolt and examines its causes. He characterizes the rebellion as a defense of the Maya moral economy, and shows how administrative reforms and new economic demands imposed by colonial authorities at the end of the seventeenth century challenged Maya norms about the ritual obligations of community leaders, the need for reciprocity in political affairs, and the supernatural origins of power.The first book-length study of the Tzeltal Revolt, Soldiers of the Virgin goes beyond the conventions of the regional monograph to offer an expansive view of Maya social and cultural history. With an eye to the contributions of archaeologists and ethnographers, Gosner explores many issues that are central to Maya studies, including the origins of the civil-religious hierarchy, the role of shamanism in political culture, the social dynamics of peasant corporate communities, and the fate of the native nobility after the Spanish conquest.</p><p>"Gosner has a good story to tell, and by and large does so intelligibly, at times poetically, unusual in a scholar nowadays. . . . This book is the most detailed and the best published treatment of the subject that I have seen." &#x2014;<i>Catholic Historical Review</i>"It differs from other historical and anthropological studies on the Tzeltal rebellion in going beyond the material causes of the uprising to focus on its cultural context." &#x2014;<i>Choice</i>"Kevin Gosner's elegantly written persuasively argued book shows that the roots of the 1712 Tzeltal Revolt in highland Chiapas, Mexico, lay as much in the world view and cultural beliefs of these Maya groups as in their material conditions. . . . An illuminating addition to an extensive literature on colonial rebellions." &#x2014;<i>Journal of the West</i>"A valuable addition to the changing view of native participation. The work clearly shows that Indian peoples were not just passive victims, but could and did take control and strongly resist Spanish attempts to subvert and eliminate their culture. . . . His argument is well presented, with extensive bibliographic information and documentary sources. . . . This book will be of real interest both to scholars of the area and general readers." &#x2014;<i>The Journal of Arizona History</i></p><h2>The Lionel Inspiration</h2><p>Fascinating book showing the prototypes that Lionel use to produce O-Gauge models during the 1940s and 1950s.

Even while on vacation at the lush Spanish resort of Costa Brava, Udo is unable to tear himself away from a game he's begun with a beach worker. He ignores his girlfriend as she goes off to enjoy the company of Charly and Hanna, another German couple that can be counted among the many people Udo cannot stand. When Charly goes missing, Udo shows little interest, choosing instead to plot the conquering movements of his army tokens as they march across a hexagonally divided map of Europe.</p> <p>It may not be the best introduction for new readers of the late Chilean author Roberto Bolano, but fans of his biggest works, such as his international breakout <em>The Savage Detectives</em> or the posthumous five-volume epic <em>2666</em>, will see familiar elements and themes in <em>The Third Reich</em>. Bolano draws a fine line between memory and reality, but blurs them in the final pages, as the novel slowly drifts from realism to a nightmarish fever dream--leaving readers with an ending that is ambiguous yet haunting. <em>--Kevin Nguyen</em></p><b>Roberto Bola�o</b> was born in Santiago, Chile, in 1953.

Bass gives a history of his years with Colter as a way of understanding what is intuitive in his quest to create art</p><p>paper 1-57131-224-2 Bass (Where the Sea Used to Be, 1998, etc.) identifies the triangulate elements used to chart the course of his life and writing. The Bassian motivational universe is hardly a national secret, even to those most fleetingly acquainted with his work: In fiction and nonfiction, it is cut of a cloth, in praise and in defense of those wild places left on earth. One of his three essentials is thus place, in particular the Yaak valley of northwest Montana, his home, inspiration, solace, and love. On that place runs the brown dog, Bass's pointer, as graceful in the natural world as Bass would like to be. His dog, as irreducible as an element, goes lost, and his valley is imperiled by the same forces that rob wildness everywhere. What happens, Bass asks, when the durable falls away, when vital tethers are severed? ``What kind of stories do we tell, as we are falling? How do we live our lives?'' Two more guiding stars appear in his firmament: activism and writing. Both he considers as shadows compared with the reala rock is real, a wolf, a fir tree, his dogbut activism is the tool our political culture affords those who are fiercely protective of the real, and no matter how tedious or against the grain, it must be deployed, and it must be done artfully. Writing as well can touch the wild, ``having protected, kept alive, or even enhanced the shape'' of the landscape's gifts. For Bass, these three anchors are also sanctuaries, one of which he will choose as a place where he can hide from the other two; each also opens up experiences left untouched by the others, to be explored as one might a strange house, room to room. Bass is an eloquent essayist; he somehow avoids sermonizing while lecturing, though he too often writes of things better seen and not said, like ``starlight on the fur of sleeping wolves,'' which sounds awfully mawkish. Pleasant, but Bass's credo didn't need a separate book to clarify; none of his works skirt the issue. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In four essays, Bass (The Sky, The Stars, The Wilderness, etc.) ponders the relationship between literature and activism, organically fusing nature writing, environmentalism and the quest for meaning, leaping from the particular to the universal, from individual worries to planetary concerns, with breathtaking ease. As Bass discusses the difficulty of juggling the roles of writer and conservationist, his central theme emerges: art, which makes order out of chaos, and activism, which transforms the physical world, complement each other. The unifying thread in these reflections, oddly, is Colter, Bass's brown, German shorthaired pointer, a dog that helped him hunt grouse and pheasants in Montana's north woods. Bass draws some strained parallels between the dog's dexterity and the artist's forays into reality and imagination, yet anyone who has ever mourned the loss of a pet (and especially readers who have actually worked with dogs, as hunters do) will find solace in his soaring tribute to man's best friend. The collection's other major motif is the importance of preserving the Yaak, a wild valley between the Pacific Northwest and the northern Rockies where a handful of caribou, grizzly bears, bald eagles and other endangered species still survive. Bass believes that the area's logging industry should give way to sustainable forestry, and he calls for federal protection of his home's roadless wildlands. These eloquent essays renew the spirit and reawaken the senses. (May) FYI: Brown Dog of the Yaak launches Milkweed's new Credo series, which will address the concerns of contemporary nature writers.

You bet. Along with the venerable art house's more predictable offerings on Matisse, Picasso, and other masters have come a spate of beautiful coffee-table tomes devoted to golf and golf courses. The latest, adapted from a feature in <i>Golf</i> magazine, rates and profiles golf resorts around the world, offering reasonably detailed descriptions of the courses as well as overviews of the accommodations, restaurants, and other amenities available to the visitor. The text is organized geographically, beginning with Hawaii and concluding with Australia and Asia. The real treat here, of course, is the photographs by Mike Klemme, which not only showcase the most photogenic holes on the various courses, but also provide aerial views of the resorts and interior shots of the guest rooms. This mouthwatering guide will make ideal browsing for golfers, whether they are planning a trip or just dreaming about one. <i>Bill Ott</i></p><h2>THE TEXTILE TOOLS OF COLONIAL HOMES</h2><p>The Textile Tools of Colonial Homes [Jan 01, 1971] Channing, Marion L. ...</p><p></p><h2>Objects of Desire</h2><p>Traces and analyzes the history of product design since 1750, beginning with the design and marketing innovations of Josiah Wedgwood, and examines how product design came into existence, how it influences our choices, and what is says about society</p><p>A social history of industrial and consumer design, this provocative study opens up new ways of looking at thousands of objects in our daily environment. Forty, a British architectural historian, notes that design changes have played a key role in gaining acceptance for products and creating wealth. Eighteenth century manufacturers drew heavily on archaic models to overcome consumer resistance to new technology, whereas contemporary makers of high-tech gadgets design utopian images promising a better future. The Victorian home, a sentimental "palace of illusions," was stuffed with theatrical furniture and intricate harmonies that smothered all associations with the unscrupulous world of commerce and work. Notions of cleanliness and hygiene have figured prominently in design, from Le Corbusier's polished exteriors to the streamlining of railway compartment upholstery to remodeling of bathroom fixtures and vacuum cleaners. Forty shows that much more than artistic taste goes into design considerations. Hundreds of illustrations are interwoven with the text. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Intriguing for its illustrations of oddities in the history of industrial design (e.g., the Squirrel sewing machine, 1858), Forty's analysis is basically soft-sell Marxist ideology, written for general readers. The author's research is based primarily upon secondary sources, with comments added to demonstrate his thesis: "To make sense of design, we must recognize that its disguising, concealing, and tranforming powers have been essential to the progress of modern industrial societies." Chapters are thematic: "Hygiene and Cleanliness," for example, treats refrigerators, bathrooms, railway coach cars, school chairs, and vacuum cleaners.

James Bond.&#x201d; Since Sean Connery first uttered that iconic phrase in <i>Dr. No,</i> more than one quarter of the world&#x2019;s population has seen a 007 film. Witty and urbane, Bond seduces and kills with equal ease often, it seems, with equal enthusiasm. This enthusiasm, coupled with his freedom to do what is forbidden to everyone else, evokes fascinating philosophical questions. Here, 15 witty, thought-provoking essays discuss hidden issues in Bond&#x2019;s world, from his carnal pleasures to his license to kill. Among the lively topics explored are Bond&#x2019;s relation to existentialism, including his graduation beyond good and evil&#x201d;; his objectification of women; the paradox of breaking the law in order to ultimately uphold it like any stupid policeman&#x201d;; the personality of 007 in terms of Plato&#x2019;s moral psychology; and the Hegelian quest for recognition evinced by Bond villains. A reference guide to all the Bond movies rounds out the book&#x2019;s many pleasures.</p><p>The latest volume in the Popular Culture and Philosophy series (which has also tackled the philosophical import of the Simpsons and Bob Dylan, among others) is sure to appeal to Bond fans. The contributors, professional philosophers, ask us to look at 007 as Kierkegaard's "seducer," a man who lives "purely at the aesthetic level of existence"; or as one of Plato's three archetypes (specifically the Guardian, a man ruled by honor, glory, and competitiveness). We examine the superspy's reasoning, objectification of women, and notions of retribution. The book is written for the lay reader--both in terms of philosophy and Bond knowledge (though a little familiarity with 007 lore helps). Fortunately, the contributors explain their philosophical terms clearly and without appearing to be dumbing anything down. Bond fans and readers with a philosophical bent will give this one a big thumbs-up. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Widely employed in traditional shamanic societies, entheogens figure prominently in the origins of religion and their use continues today throughout the world. They alter consciousness in such a profound way that, depending on the set and setting, they can produce the ultimate human experience: union with God or revelation of other mystical realities. <br> <br>With contributions by Albert Hofmann, Terence McKenna, Ann and Alexander Shulgin, Thomas Riedlinger, Dale Pendell, and Rick Strassman as well as interviews with R. Gordon Wasson and Jack Kornfield, this book explores ancient and modern uses of psychedelic drugs, emphasizing the complementary relationship between science and mystical experience and the importance of psychedelics to the future of religion and society. Revealing the mystical-religious possibilities of substances such as psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline, and LSD, this book exposes the vital need for developing an organized spiritual context for their use in order to fully realize their transformative and sacred value. Stressing the importance of academic and religious freedom, the authors call for a revival of scientific and religious inquiry into entheogens so they may be used safely and legally by those seeking to cultivate spiritual awareness. <br> <br>ROBERT FORTE, AMRS, began his work with psychedelics as a student of Stanislav Grof and Frank Barron, cofounder of the Harvard Psilocybin Project. He obtained his master&#x2019;s degree under Mircea Eliade and has collaborated with many of the leaders in the field of psychedelics, including R. Gordon Wasson, Timothy Leary, and Huston Smith.

In addition to his philosophical teachings, he provided ideas for the development of many practical activities, including education, agriculture, medicine, economics, architecture, science, religion, and the arts. <br><br> Steiner&#x2019;s original contribution to human knowledge was based on his ability to conduct &#x201c;spiritual research,&#x201d; the investigation of metaphysical dimensions of existence. With his scientific and philosophical training, he brought a new systematic discipline to the field, allowing for conscious methods and comprehensive results. A natural seer from childhood, he cultivated his spiritual vision to a high degree, enabling him to speak with authority on previously veiled mysteries of life. <br><br> In this introductory reader, Matthew Barton has collected excerpts from Steiner&#x2019;s many talks and writings on the subject of Michaelmas, one of the key spiritual festivals of the yearly cycle. The volume also features an editorial introduction, afterword, commentary, and notes. <br><br> <b>Chapters:</b> <ul> <li> Sinking Earth, Rising Spirit </li> <li> Michael and the Dragon </li> <li> Michael, Spirit of Our Age </li> <li> Toward a Michael Festival </li> </ul></p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.<br><br><b>Matthew Barton</b>&nbsp;is a translator, editor, teacher, and poet, and taught kindergarten for many years at the Bristol Waldorf School.

This collection of interviews spans Harry Smith&#39;s long and influential life in American arts and letters. They cover a quarter-century, touching on the full range of Smith&#39;s activity as a groundbreaking experimental filmmaker, obsessive collector, folk music anthologist, visionary painter, student of Native American lore, anthropologist, cosmographer, alchemist, hermetic scholar, occultist, autodidact, classic American eccentric, and all-around explorer of the possibilities of human consciousness and creativity. Jordan Belson writes, &#34;THINK OF THE SELF SPEAKING is the next best thing to being with Harry himself-perhaps better, certainly safer. The interviews are remarkably similar to his collage films. A brilliant mind unhinged.&#34; Includes an introduction by Allen Ginsberg.</p><p>Perhaps it's better to <i>read</i> about talking with Harry Smith than it was to actually talk with him; given the choice, most of us might prefer our Smith-viewing from a safe distance. Famous for assembling the brilliant, idiosyncratic <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i>, Smith was an avant-garde filmmaker and painter, occultist, anthropologist, alchemist, compulsive collector of music, books, textiles, paper airplanes, and string figures--in short, the original interdisciplinary scholar, all without benefit of formal training or degree. He was also a notoriously difficult person. Brilliant, irascible, perpetually drunk or high, he hit up every acquaintance for money, borrowed movie cameras then pawned them, bragged about spending grant money on heroin. According to his own account, he first tried peyote just outside the trailer court of legendary hillbilly singer Sara Carter, then proceeded to make the understandably perplexed Carter identify which of her quilt designs resembled which of her songs.<p> Smith wasn't an easy interview. He browbeat his interviewers, eluded their questions, then announced he was on speed and therefore not to be trusted. ("Smith: Would you like me to read your fortune? Gary Kenton: Later. HS: It's bad. GK: Now, talk to me a little bit about... HS: It's bad.") But his was a mind of the most unusual sort, capable of forging connections between the most esoteric and far-flung subjects. Ukrainian Easter eggs, Kiowa chants, Oz, Aboriginal bark paintings, the Kaballah, Levi-Strauss, Thelonious Monk, surrealism--seemingly no field was outside his range of expertise. Over the years, Smith destroyed many of his creations and, in the end, denigrated the others, including the hugely influential <i>Anthology</i>. Perhaps it was his life itself that became his greatest work. As preserved in these interviews, it's the final and most enduring tall tale from the greatest intellectual trickster of his time. <i>--Mary Park</i></p></p><h2>Heritage Studies 6 (Heritage Studies for Christian Schools)</h2><p>The Student Worktext is a full-color complement with study questions.

Simple, straightforward writing saves time, creates good relationships, and prevents expensive misunderstandings. But why is it so hard to achieve? This incisive guide suggests ways to think about writing -- what it should look and sound like, as well as what it should accomplish -- that can simplify how writers choose to express their ideas. It examines the reasons why many businesspeople with good skills tend to write strange, needlessly complicated sentences -- and shows them how to break the habit. Plain Style offers 35 practical techniques that foster simplicity, conciseness, and emphasis.</p><p>Lauchman, who teaches business writing to corporations, adopts a low-key, practical, sometimes iconoclastic approach to the writing that people are required to do every day "where money changes hands." Writers, he says, should convey and not express. He talks in terms of "the order of words" rather than of dangling participles and misplaced modifiers. The many examples are often humorous and the comparisons excellent (e.g., extra words are compared to too much water in tea). Interestingly, he declares that bad writing is not taught in school but learned on the job and is often perpetuated by company style guidebooks and managerial reviews. Although the book is sometimes redundant and awkward in its attempt not to sound like a traditional grammar, business writers will enjoy it and benefit from it. Of interest to public, academic, and special libraries.<br><i>- Nancy Shires, East Carolina Univ., Greenville, N.C.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.A commonly voiced complaint today is that the average person cannot express him- or herself in writing. Lauchman, head of a firm specializing in training professionals to write better, disagrees. The problem, he says, is that writing is often intended to impress others or conceal meaning. He describes the result as counterproductive, irresponsible, and needlessly complex. What Lauchman offers are three dozen guidelines designed to eliminate obfuscating jargon and convoluted constructions. He also dismisses as grammatical "dogma" rigid injunctions against split infinitives and one-sentence paragraphs and offers examples of when such violations may be appropriate. <i>Plain Style</i> is a fine addition to any memo writer's reference shelf. <i>David Rouse</i></p><h2>The New York Times Heritage Cook Book</h2><p>The New York Times Heritage Cookbook, 1972, by Jean Hewitt.

His diaries record a judicious blend of aesthetics, theatre lore, love, marriage, sex and politics.</p><p>John Lahr has been writing about theatre and popular culture for The New Yorker since 1992. He is the author of sixteen books, among them Notes on a Cowardly Lion: The Biography of Bert Lahr and Prick up Your Ears: The Biography of Joe Orton and Dame Edna Everage and The Rise of Western Civilization.Every so often a book proves so compelling that certain sections beg to be read aloud the "hey, listen to this!" syndrome. Readers of Tynan's rambunctious recollections better rehearse their oratory, as every page here contains a minimum of two such passages. These entries, consistently fascinating, also manage to be witty (frequently of the laugh-out-loud variety), thought-provoking (few sacred cows escape Tynan's dead-on skewering) or raunchy (not a few sections should carry an "R" rating). Tynan, who in 1980 succumbed to a years-long battle with pulmonary emphysema (at age 53), was one of Britain's foremost drama critics; here, he spent two seasons as theater critic for the New Yorker. Along with Laurence Olivier, he helped found London's National Theater, where he functioned as literary manager for 10 years. Not surprisingly, Tynan dissects theatrical foibles and politicking with a keen inside perspective; he can also discourse on the European common market, Spaniards' attitudes toward homosexuality, cricket, French cuisine, Ethel Merman and much more. He's eminently quotable, often suggesting Oscar Wilde on ecstasy. Celebrated names are not merely dropped (from Katharine Hepburn and Princess Margaret to W.H. Auden and Jerry Lewis), but integral to his revelatory anecdotes. Colorful turns of phrase proliferate (a hearse is a "sepulchral flivver"; a luncheon-club group, aspiring to Algonquin Round Table status, is a "lovable, bawdy throng of deaf, drunken, droning monologuists"; Cordova is "a fetid yawn of a city"). Nor does Tynan shy away from his own perspicacity: indeed, there are many spanking good passages here about, well, good spanking (Tynan's sexual activity of choice). <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Blue Guide Provence &amp; the Cote D'Azur (1st ed)</h2><p>The brash seediness of Marseilles; the glamour of Nice, Cannes, and St. Tropez; the charm of historic Arles, Orange, and Avignon --these are just a few of the places covered in this new Blue Guide.

For over three centuries, it served as&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;standard English Bible and has, as such, exerted unparalleled influence on English and American culture in nearly every sphere&#x2014;including education, law, literature, government, art, science, and religion.</p><p><em>The Legacy of the King James Bible</em>&nbsp;honors the 400th&nbsp;anniversary of the KJB&#x2019;s publication by telling its story&#x2014;a drama that starts with the pioneering work of William Tyndale and progresses through half a dozen other popular translations. Leland Ryken, an expert on the Bible as literature, explores the excellence of the King James Bible by examining its status as the climax of a century of English Bible translations, its impression on the subsequent history of Bible translation, its inherent literary excellence, and its overall impact on English and American literature and culture.&nbsp;<em>The Legacy of the King James Bible</em>&nbsp;will shed new light on the depth of the translation&#x2019;s merit and influence and offer insight as to what its role may be in the next 400 years.</p></p><p><p><strong>Leland Ryken</strong> (PhD, University of Oregon) served as professor of English at Wheaton College for nearly 50 years. He has authored or edited over fifty books, including <em>The Word of God in English</em> and <em>A Complete Handbook of Literary Forms in the Bible</em>. He is a frequent speaker at the Evangelical Theological Society's annual meetings and served as literary stylist for the English Standard Version Bible.</p><p>&#x201c;A very accessible and informed guide to this magisterial English translation of the Bible. Few will fail to benefit from its wisdom and learning.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Alister McGrath</strong>, Andreas Idreos Professor of Science and Religion, University of Oxford</p><p>&#x201c;What a treat&#x2014;the leading evangelical scholar on the Bible as literature discussing the Bible translation that is probably the greatest achievement in English literature! Ryken tells the story of how the King James Version came into being and describes its wide-ranging impact over the last four hundred years, while frankly contrasting the literary merits of the KJV with some of the modern translations. This is an important topic treated well. I found it riveting and edifying.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Ray Van Neste</strong><strong>, </strong>Associate Professor of Biblical Studies; Director, R. C. Ryan Center for Biblical Studies, Union University</p><p>&#x201c;Who would be more qualified to write the definitive study of the history, stylistic excellence, and pervasive influence of the King James Bible than a distinguished professor of English, Milton scholar, expert on Puritanism, and authority on the Bible as literature? Professor Ryken fills the bill, and he has produced an exemplary work: its research is extensive, its scholarship is impressive, its argument is reasonable, and its readability makes it accessible to scholar and layperson alike.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>D. G. Kehl</strong><strong>, </strong>Professor of English Emeritus, Arizona State University; author, <em>The Literary Style of the Old Bible and the New</em></p><p>&#x201c;Leland Ryken skillfully traces the King James Version&#x2019;s powerful influence on the history, culture, and literature of the English-speaking peoples. Drawing upon a lifetime of scholarship in both English literature and the Bible, Ryken has written a valuable volume celebrating the most important book in the English language.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Diane Lynn Severance</strong><strong>, </strong>Director, Dunham Bible Museum, Houston Baptist University</p><p>&#x201c;Leland Ryken is eminently qualified to write a book on the legacy of the King James Bible. His years of teaching sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English literature and his extensive writings on the Bible as literature and familiarity with modern English translations put him in the seat of profound authority. His personal acquaintance with the text of the KJV from a very early age gives his delightful stories a ring of authenticity. Dr. Ryken will lead you into a deep appreciation of this four-hundred-year-old translation&#x2014;the beauty of its language, its undeniable influence on American and English culture, and its molding of literary personalities, poets, musicians, and yes, even politicians. Once I began reading Ryken&#x2019;s book, I couldn&#x2019;t put it down. It will tempt you to go to your bookshelf, blow the dust off your KJV, and begin reading it again. Ryken has clearly and precisely demonstrated what has made it such an enduring cultural phenomenon&#x2014;the simplicity of its prose, the beauty of its poetry, the cadence of its diction, and the grandeur of its message.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Donald L. Brake</strong><strong>, </strong>Dean Emeritus, Multnomah Biblical Seminary; author, <em>A Visual History of the King James Bible</em></p><p>&#x201c;The story of the making of the King James Bible has been told before, but given popular misconceptions it deserves retelling. An especially valuable feature of Leland Ryken's <em>The Legacy of the King James Bible</em> for many readers will be Ryken's rich description of the translation's literary and cultural impact, as well as his examination of key questions too many take for granted: what makes a Bible literary, and what constitutes this Bible's remarkable prose and poetic style?&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Hannibal Hamlin</strong><strong>, </strong>Associate Professor of English, The Ohio State University; co-editor, <em>The King James Bible after Four Hundred Years</em></p><p>&#x201c;Leland Ryken comes not to bury the King James Bible at its 400th birthday, although he knows full well it may be dying. He comes not to praise the King James Bible, although he is fully alive to its astonishing beauty, teachings, and influence. He comes simply to document a fundamental truth we must never forget: that the KJV was the best translation of many great translations in its own day and that even if it dies tomorrow in a world that seems to have lost both its inner and outer ears, it will live on forever through its words reflected in the work of some of the greatest musicians, painters, poets, preachers, playwrights, and prose writers of all time.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Al Elmore</strong><strong>, </strong>Professor of English and Drama, Athens State University</p></p><h2>Something in the Cellar...: Ronald Searle&#39;s Wonderful World of Wine</h2><p>Illustrated in Searle&#39;s inimitable style are the ancient noble ceremony of slashing the trockenbeerenauslese, the inauguration of the first authentic denominazione di origine controllata e garantita, and the vinolympics.

Blackthorne and I were seated in the library of the Helena Stockmen&#x2019;s Club on Fuller Street, drinking claret with a shard of rye, the Judge&#x2019;s own concoction, called Old Thunder&#x2019;s Gavel by the deputies who served him. The only book present was a hollowed-out copy of the <i>Montana Territorial Code</i> containing the pocket model Colt the Judge carried in response to the latest threat against his life. The club&#x2019;s reading material stood in presses in the dining room, clearing space for its much larger liquor supply inside oak cabinets in the room where we sat.His expression betrayed a piety that didn&#x2019;t match his Satanic features and pitchfork beard. But as usual he shifted his annoyance to a less revealing subject. &#x201c;Damn it, Deputy, I know your prejudice against displaying the badge of office, but you might pay me the respect of wearing it in my presence.&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes, Your Honor.&#x201d; I foraged it from a pocket and pinned it on. Blackthorne scowled whenever I addressed him by any title other than Judge. Anything else didn&#x2019;t quite fit my mouth, although I could get out a proper &#x201c;sir&#x201d; in times of admiration; and I did admire him, but I&#x2019;d take a bullet through the star before I&#x2019;d say it. He was a vain old rooster who never forgot an insult or a compliment.He dismissed the shaft with a gesture that told me how deep I&#x2019;d struck. I&#x2019;d just returned from a messy errand in Oregon that had reflected badly on us both as well as on the federal court, and I hadn&#x2019;t scrupled to remind him I&#x2019;d been against it from the start. That I was there at all when I should have been on leave while tempers cooled said he needed me for something unpleasant, and I was determined to let him twist until he got to the point.&#x201c;Do you seriously know nothing of Scripture?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d expect someone of your frontier stock to have been brought up on sourdough and Jesus.&#x201d;&#x201c;Dugouts are designed for getting snowed in. There was always plenty of Jesus when the bread ran out. I caught a case of devotion, but it was like measles. You don&#x2019;t get it twice.&#x201d;&#x201c;Have you no faith apart from your oath to the Union?&#x201d;&#x201c;I took it with my hand on a Bible. If I thought it was for more than show I&#x2019;d have sworn on my pistol. I&#x2019;ve seen good men die and bad men prosper, but never an angel to tip the scale. If I ever was going to, it would have been at Murfreesboro.&#x201d;&#x201c;Are you an atheist?&#x201d;&#x201c;I never liked the ones who claimed to be. They all tried to convert me.&#x201d;&#x201c;An agnostic?&#x201d;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;He frowned as if I&#x2019;d made an inappropriate jest. The truth was I didn&#x2019;t know what the word meant. I learned later it was of recent coinage.&#x201c;But you can sham belief,&#x201d; he said.I&#x2019;d no idea where the conversation was headed, but already I didn&#x2019;t care for it by half. The Judge was a regularattending Presbyterian; whether that was for community relations or because he thought as much of his immortal soul as he did of the bench wasn&#x2019;t something he shared with those of us who provided him with defendants, and I doubted he was any more forthcoming with his prosecutor or the local leaders he met with formally and at poker. I&#x2019;d have suspected him of leading up to a dire announcement if I weren&#x2019;t certain he intended to live forever.I said, &#x201c;I can be an eagle or a duck. Which one depends on the job.&#x201d;&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t said there is a job. You&#x2019;re on inactive duty.&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true. As long as we&#x2019;re just chewing the fat, where do you stand on Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter finding baby Moses in the rushes? She spun a good yarn, but that was the last time anyone believed a story like it.&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s blasphemous.&#x201d;&#x201c;You ought to know. You&#x2019;re using Holy Writ to recruit me for work.&#x201d;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re hopeless.&#x201d;&#x201c;If I didn&#x2019;t have hope I&#x2019;d be dead in Oregon.&#x201d;The forbidden subject jerked him back onto the rails. He rang for the steward, a bald, leathery Scot in a rusty tailcoat who&#x2019;d navigated for Lewis and Clark and Noah, and asked him to fetch the big atlas from the dining room.When he returned lugging a cloth-bound volume the size of a saddle blanket, Blackthorne opened it across the arms of his chair, made heretical marks on one of the watercolor maps with a gravity pen, and sat back. I rose and circled behind to study it over his shoulder. With a sinking heart I recognized the outline of Texas, my least favorite place after Dakota; which to be fair to Dakota had only been the place where I&#x2019;d almost been slaughtered by the Cheyenne Nation. Even worse, the marks he&#x2019;d made were in the panhandle, a spot that existed because the same incessant wind that blew it away daily blew in fresh dirt from Mexico. The panhandle would disappear when the sand ran out.&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve marked the sites of five armed robberies that have taken place in the past six months,&#x201d; Blackthorne said. &#x201c;Two banks, an Overland stage, two trains. The banks aren&#x2019;t our concern, but mail was stolen from the Overland and one of the trains, and that is.&#x201d;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with the federal court in Austin?&#x201d;&#x201c;Its deputy marshals are spread thin over a jurisdiction the size of France. The Texas Rangers, who normally can be depended upon to fill the gap, are busy patrolling the border of Mexico for <i>bandidos</i>. Governor Ireland has asked us for our help, after Isaac Parker in Arkansas turned him down for obvious reasons.&#x201d;Parker was the only U.S. jurist who was more put-upon than Blackthorne, with seventy-four thousand square miles of Indian Territory to tame by way of two hundred deputy marshals and a gallows in Fort Smith the size of a frigate. The two despised each other for reasons unknown to me, but they were united in their contempt for interferers from Washington.&#x201c;Still, five robberies. We can scrape up that many in parts of Montana most seasons. What&#x2019;s our end?&#x201d;&#x201c;Method of operations was nearly identical in all five. That suggests the same band. At the pace they&#x2019;re going, they&#x2019;ll fish out their current waters in short order and relocate. I&#x2019;d rather we fought them on Texas ground than ours. Innocent bystanders there are spread out more and less likely to take a stray round.&#x201d;That was thin even for him, but I didn&#x2019;t press the point. If he were going to confide the truth to me, he wouldn&#x2019;t have bothered to put up even so transparent a lie. In any case we were interrupted by the antique steward, who&#x2019;d returned to ask if we wanted more refreshment. To my surprise the Judge nodded, and the Scot took from a cabinet a cut-glass decanter and from another a bottle of Monongahela and mixed their contents in our empty glasses. Blackthorne was a one-drink, one-cigar man by order of his physician, who had seen him through a heart attack, and no one who answered to the Judge had ever asked for seconds in his presence.Except me, of course; but this was the first time he&#x2019;d joined me in the rebellion.If the steward noticed that a valuable book from the club&#x2019;s collection had been defaced, his expression didn&#x2019;t show it, and he left without remark. Membership was restricted to owners of ranches exclusively, but although Blackthorne held no title to a single square inch of real property, an exception had been made in his case because he&#x2019;d tried and convicted rustlers with such Old Testament fervor that not so much as a stolen pair of horns had crossed the territorial line in more than a year. It stood to reason that until one did, he could scribble dirty pictures all over the walls of the reception room on Ladies&#x2019; Night without a mark appearing against his name in the register.He closed the atlas and slid it over the arm of his chair until it leaned against the side. For a few moments I watched him shifting his weight on the cushions in search of a compromise between his bony angles and the arrangement of horsehair in the upholstery. The only seat that really suited him was the one behind the high bench in the courthouse. Just because he was physically restless, however, didn&#x2019;t mean he wasn&#x2019;t complacent in his mind. He knew I would raise the subject sooner or later.I took a long draught of the Gavel and gave him his way. &#x201c;The Bible.&#x201d;&#x201c;I take solace from it often. The beauty of the Song of Solomon stands out against its background of war, plague, and human sacrifice. I was reminded of it when &#x2018;Whispering Hope&#x2019; swept through town last year; I was trying a case of rape, murder, and dismemberment, and the strains came through the window as an eyewitness was testifying. I was comforted by the reflection that ugliness and beauty&#x2014;hell and redemption, if you will&#x2014;have abided side by side on earth since the beginning. All the changes are superficial. I wonder if the Israelites gathered in the courtyard of the palace to predict Judgment Day the way our street philosophers do on Catholic Hill?&#x201d;&#x201c;If so, and Solomon&#x2019;s father David was in charge, he&#x2019;d have stuck them in the front lines and given them the first look.&#x201d;&#x201c;So some of the Word remained with you after all.&#x201d;&#x201c;Not enough to get me from the Kingdom of Israel to the panhandle of Texas.&#x201d;He ran a finger around the top of his glass, drawing a dull hum from the crystal. He made some kind of decision and set it on his chairside table untouched. &#x201c;Each of those robberies took place within three days&#x2019; ride of Owen, a former buffalo-hunting center more lately concerned with sheepherding, with all the complications that represents with the local cattle interests. Full-time brigand is passing out of fashion. Increased numbers of law enforcement officers and the Pinkertons&#x2019; stranglehold has forced many road agents into the cover of legitimate employment. Jesse James and the Youngers scorned the life of the working ranch hand, but most of the later breed has come out of line shacks and the bunkhouse and fly back into them between raids. My theory is you&#x2019;re more likely to find these highwaymen rounding up strays in Palo Duro Canyon than hiding out in some cave planning their next outrage.&#x201c;The challenge, of course, is to penetrate that close society without raising the alarm&#x2014;sending them into flight or open confrontation with their loyal friends at their side. A band of officers would bring about the former, and a single man poking about would almost certainly end up bleaching his bones somewhere on the Staked Plain. However, there is one profession that thrives on a healthy knowledge of the lives of the members of his community without arousing suspicion, and without prowling beyond his station and the various tables where he is invited to break bread.&#x201d;I saw where he was heading then, and felt a nasty grin splitting my face. &#x201c;I can stand for a cowhand because I&#x2019;ve been one, and they took me for a saloonkeeper down in New Mexico because I know my way around a bar, but the first time I thump a pulpit, they&#x2019;ll smell brimstone clear to Chicago.&#x201d;&#x201c;You fail to appreciate the proposition.

He teaches comparative literature at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.&nbsp;He lives with his wife and family in Manhattan.<br><br><br><br>Lavender<br>&nbsp;<br><br>I<br>Life begins somewhere with the scent of lavender. My father is standing in front of a mirror. He has just showered and shaved and is about to put on a suit. I watch him tighten the knot of his necktie, flip down his shirt collar, and button it up. Suddenly, there it is, as always: lavender.<br>I know where it comes from. An elaborately shaped bottle sits on the dresser. One day, when I&#x2019;m having a very bad migraine and am lying on the living room sofa, my mother, scrambling for something to take my mind off the pain, picks up the bottle, unscrews the cap, and dabs some of its contents onto a handkerchief, which she then brings to my nose. Instantly, I feel better. She lets me keep the handkerchief. I like to hold it in my fist, with my head tilted slightly back, as if I&#x2019;d been punched in a fistfight and were still bleeding&#x2014;or the way I&#x2019;d seen others do when they were feeling sick or crushed and walked about the house taking occasional sniffs through crumpled handkerchiefs in what looked like last-ditch efforts to avoid a fainting spell. I liked the handkerchief, liked the secret scent emanating from within its folds, liked smuggling it to school and taking furtive whiffs in class, because the scent brought me back to my parents, to their living room, and into a world that was so serene that just inhaling its scent cast a protective cloud around me. Smell lavender and I was sheltered, happy, beloved. Smell lavender and in came good thoughts&#x2014;about life, about those I loved, about me. Smell lavender and, no matter how far from one another, we were all gathered in one warm, snug room stuffed with pillows, close to a crackling fire, with the patter of rain outside to remind us our lives were secure. Smell lavender and you couldn&#x2019;t pull us apart.<br>My father&#x2019;s old cologne can be found the world over. I have only to walk into a large department store and there it is. Half a century later it looks exactly the same. I could, if I were prescient enough and did not want to risk walking into a store one day and not finding it, purchase a tiny bottle and keep it somewhere, as a stand-in for my father, for my love of lavender, or for that fall evening when, as an adolescent, I&#x2019;d gone with my mother to buy my first aftershave but couldn&#x2019;t make up my mind and returned alone the next evening after school, happy to discover, among so many other things, that a man could use shaving as an excuse for wearing perfume.<br>I was baffled to find there were so many scents in the world, and even more baffled to find my father&#x2019;s scent among them. I asked the salesman to let me sample my father&#x2019;s brand, mispronouncing its name on purpose, overdoing my surprise as I examined its slanted shape as though it were a stranger whom I had hailed in error, knowing that the bottle and I were on intimate terms at home, that if it knew every twist my worst migraines took&#x2014;as I knew every curve on its body&#x2014;it knew of my imaginary flights from school in Mother&#x2019;s handkerchief, knew more about my fantasies than I dared know myself. And yet, in the shop that was about to close that day and whose owner was growing ever more impatient with my inability to choose, I felt mesmerized by something new, something at once dangerous and enticing, as though these numberless bottles, neatly arranged in stacks around the store, held the promise of nights out in large cities where everything from the buildings, lights, faces, foods, places, and the bridges I&#x2019;d end up crossing made the world ever more desirable, if only because I too, by virtue of this or that potion, had become desirable&#x2014;to others, to myself.<br>I spent an hour testing bottles. In the end I bought a lavender cologne, but not my father&#x2019;s. After paying and having the package gift wrapped, I felt as though I&#x2019;d been handed a birth certificate or a new passport. This would be me&#x2014;or me as long as the bottle lasted. Then we&#x2019;d have to look into the matter again.<br>Over time, I discovered all kinds of lavenders. There were light, ethereal lavenders; some were mild and timid; others lush and overbearing; some tart, as if picked from the field and left to parch in large vats of vinegar; others were overwhelmingly sweet. Some lavenders ended up smelling like an herb garden; others, with hints of so many spices, were blended beyond recognition.<br>I experimented with each one, purchased many bottles, not just because I wanted to collect them all or was searching for the ideal lavender&#x2014;the hidden lavender, the ur-lavender that superseded all other lavenders&#x2014;but because I was eager to either prove or disprove something I suspected all along: that the lavender I wanted was none other than the one I&#x2019;d grown up with and would ultimately turn back to once I&#x2019;d established that all the others were wrong for me. Perhaps the lavender I wanted was basic lavender. Ordinary lavender. Papa&#x2019;s lavender. You go out into the world to acquire all manner of habits and learn all sorts of languages, but the one tongue you neglect most is the one you&#x2019;ve spoken at home, just as the customs you feel most comfortable with are those you never knew were customs until you saw others practice completely different ones and realized you didn&#x2019;t quite mind your own, though you&#x2019;d strayed so far now that you probably no longer knew how to practice them. I collected every fragrance in the world. But my scent&#x2014;what was <i>my</i> scent? Had I ever had a <i>scent</i>? Was there going to be one scent only, or would I want all of them?<br>What I found after purchasing several aftershaves was that they would all lose their luster, like certain elements in the actinide series that have a brief radioactive life before turning into lead. Some smelled too strong, or too weak, or too much of such and such and not enough of this or that. Some failed to bring out something essential about me; others suggested things that weren&#x2019;t in me at all. Perhaps finding fault with each fragrance was also my way of finding fault with myself, not just for choosing the wrong fragrance each time, or for even thinking I needed a fragrance in the first place, but for believing that the blessings conferred by cologne could ever bring about the new life I yearned for.<br>And yet, even as I criticized each fragrance, I found myself growing attached to it, as though something that had less to do with the fragrances themselves than with that part of me that had sought them out and been seduced by them and finally blossomed because of them should never be allowed to perish. Sometimes the history of provisional attachments means more to us than the attachments themselves, the way the history of a love affair stirs more love than the affair itself. Sometimes it is in blind ritual and not faith that we encounter the sacred, the way it is habit not character that makes us who we are. Sometimes the clothes and scents we wear have more of us in them than we do ourselves.<br>The search for ideal lavender was like the search for that part of me that needed nothing more than a fragrance to emerge from the sleep of thousands. I searched for it the way I searched for my personal color, or for a brand of cigarettes, or for my favorite composer. Finding the right lavender would finally allow me to say, &#x201c;Yes, this is me. Where was I all this time?&#x201d; Yet, no sooner is the scent purchased, than the me who was supposed to emerge&#x2014;like the us who is about to emerge when we buy new clothes, or sign up for a magazine that seems so thoroughly right for us, or purchase a membership to a health club, or move to a new city, or discover a new faith and practice new rituals with new congregants among whom we make new friends&#x2014;this me turns out to be, of course, the one we&#x2019;d always wished to mask or drive away. What did I expect? Different scent, same person.<br>Over the past thirty-five years I have tried almost all the colognes and aftershaves that perfume manufacturers have concocted. Not just lavenders, but pine, chamomile, tea, citrus, honeysuckle, fern, rosemary, and smoky variations of the most rarefied leathers and spices. I liked nothing more than to clutter my medicine cabinet and the entire rim of my bathtub with bottles two and three deep, each vial like a tiny, unhatched effigy of someone I was, or wished to be, and, for a while, thought I&#x2019;d finally become. Scent A: purchased in such and such a year, hoping to encounter happiness. Scent B: purchased while scent A was almost finished; it helped me abandon A. C, marking sudden fatigue with B. D was a gift. Never liked it; wore it to make the giver happy; stopped using it as soon as she was gone. Comes E, which I loved so much that I eventually purchased F, along with nine of its sibling scents made by the same house. Yet F managed to make me tire of E and its isotopes. Sought out G. Disliked it as soon as I realized that someone I hated loved it. Then H. How I loved H! Stayed with H for years. They don&#x2019;t make it any longer; should have stocked up on it. But then, much as I loved it, I had stopped using it long before its manufacturer discontinued it. Back to E, which I had always liked. Yes, definitely E. Until I realized there had always been something slightly off, something missing about E. I stopped using it again. Of the woman who breezed through my life and, in the ten days I knew her, altered me forever, all I remember is her gift. I continued to wear the fragrance she&#x2019;d given me as a way of thinking she&#x2019;d be back soon enough. Now, twenty years later, all that&#x2019;s left of her is a bottle that reminds me less of her than of the lover I once was.<br>I have thrown many things away in life. But aftershave bottles, never. I take these bottles wherever I move, the way the ancients traveled with their ancestral masks. Each bottle contains a part of me, the formaldehyded me, the genie of myself. One could, as in an Arabian tale, rub each bottle and summon up an earlier me. Some, despite the years, are still alive, tho...<br><br></p><h2>Soulless: The Manga</h2><p>Alexia Tarabotti is laboring under a great many social tribulations. First, she has no soul.

Their correspondence ran from 1907, the year Pound took up his virtually permanent residence in Europe, until Williams' death in 1963. The letters contribute an unparalleled documentary record of modern culture - a wealth of information about the lives and works of the two poets themselves; the literary and political movements in which they became involved and the impact of public events upon the arts; the activities of other writers and artists; and the world of small presses and little magazines that nourished the growth of modernism.<br>Pound/Williams contains 169 letters selected from the poets' surviving correspondence, each letter reproduced in full and accompanied by explanatory notes. Historical introductions place each of the live chronological groupings of letters into context, and a biographical glossary identifies persons prominently mentioned.</p><p><p>New Directions has been the primary publisher of <strong>Ezra Pound</strong> in the U.S. since the founding of the press when James Laughlin published New Directions in Prose and Poetry 1936. That year Pound was fifty-one. In Laughlin&#x2019;s first letter to Pound, he wrote: &#x201c;Expect, please, no fireworks. I am bourgeois-born (Pittsburgh); have never missed a meal. . . . But full of &#x2018;noble caring&#x2019; for something as inconceivable as the future of decent letters in the US.&#x201d; Little did Pound know that into the twenty-first century the fireworks would keep exploding as readers continue to find his books relevant and meaningful.</p><p>Besides being a practicing physician, <strong>William Carlos Williams</strong> (1883&#x2013;1963) was a poet, short-story writer, novelist, translator, playwright, and essayist whose contribution to the development of modern American poetry grew out of his commitment to recording the "local" experience of Rutherford, New Jersey, and its environs.</p>Spanning nearly a lifetime, from 1907 to 1963, the friendship between ``Liebes Ezrachen'' and ``Deer Bull'' makes up, in Pound's words, ``two halves of what might have made a fairly decent poet'' divided by ``the wide atlantic ocean.'' Their more than 50 years of animated letters started after a friendship at the University of Pennsylvania, continued through their ties to Imagism, then endured as they pursued their differing yet consonant ideas of poetry. The cosmopolitan Pound took up with expatriate T.S. Eliot (whom Williams detested) and began his inexhaustible Cantos; Williams stayed a suburban doctor-poet, championing American poets such as Marianne Moore and fashioning his own Objectivist poetry. But their always lively postal exchanges, which Williams used in his epic Paterson, extended over serious criticism of each other's work, literary gossip, recommended reading, and arguments over poetry and national identity. The peculiar intimacy of their relationship meant they disagreed repeatedly, but eventually, as this collection illustrates, it was strained by Pound's anti-Semitism and Mussolini worship until the epistolary blackout during WW II, when Pound made his treasonous broadcasts. Although Williams thought Pound was a traitor evading his fate in St. Elizabeth's asylum, their correspondence continued, Pound writing in his eclectic idiolect, Williams responding thoughtfully and at length. Unfortunately, the later scandal over Pound's award for the Pisan Cantos in 1949 and Williams's problems during the Red Scare are absent from their correspondence. Editor Witemeyer (English/Univ. of New Mexico), in addition to contributing useful introductions to each period and a sizeable ``who's who'' appendix, diligently footnotes as many references and allusions as he can (some notes are longer than the letters). A fascinating record, and a double window into the biographies of two major poets. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In a simple, rhyming text-eight short lines per page-its quest for food unfolds. Suspense builds as it runs through the snow encountering other woodland creatures (will one become its prey?). As night falls, the animal wearies and becomes vulnerable itself. Finally, a meal is captured-details of the kill are discreetly omitted from both text and illustrations-and the creature staggers home with its "prize" to a cozy den and hungry cubs. The serious topic brings to mind a documentary, but the verse and fine watercolor paintings heighten its drama. Sweeping landscapes dominated by snowy ground, bleak skies, and rich evergreens appear regularly on double-page spreads that alternate comfortably with the sedately framed white pages of measured text. Compelling closeups of the wildlife are appropriately naturalistic and marvelously textured. Overall, Bunting provides an unromanticized glimpse of survival in the wild. Her lyrical language and Minor's large-format art render this an ideal choice to read aloud or independently.<br><i>Valerie Lennox, Jacksonville Public Library, FL</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sword and Sorceress XIX</h2><p>A collection of twenty-five original &#34;sword and sorcery&#34; stories introduces a heroic cast of female characters, including a sorceress who comes up with an ingenious way to cure an entire village suffering from a devastating plague, in tales by Diana Paxson, Esther M.

The series first appeared in French in Le Petit Vingtieme, a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtieme Siecle on 10 January 1929. Set in a painstakingly researched world closely mirroring our own, Herge's Tintin series continues to be a favorite of readers and critics alike 80 years later.<br>The hero of the series is Tintin, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog Snowy (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy Captain Haddock, the bright but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (Professeur Tournesol) and other colorful supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (Dupond et Dupont). Herge himself features in several of the comics as a background character; as do his assistants in some instances.<br>The success of the series saw the serialized strips collected into a series of albums (24 in all), spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film and theatre. The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, with translations published in over 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date. <br>The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herge's signature ligne claire style. Engaging, well-researched plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories within the Tintin series always feature slapstick humor, accompanied in later albums by sophisticated satire, and political and cultural commentary.</p><p>Herge, one of the most famous Belgians in the world, was a comics writer and artist. The internationally successful Adventures of Tintin are his most well-known and beloved works. They have been translated into 38 different languages and have inspired such legends as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. He wrote and illustrated for The Adventures of Tintin until his death in 1983.Text: French</p><h2>To Make and Keep Peace Among Ourselves and with All Nations (Hoover Institution Press Publication (Hardcover))</h2><p><p>Author Angelo Codevilla asks, <i>What is to be America&#x2019;s peace? How is it to be won and preserved in our time?</i> He notes that our government&#x2019;s increasingly unlimited powers flow in part from our statesmen&#x2019;s inability to stay out of wars or to win them and that our statesmen and academics have ceased to think about such things. The purpose of this book is to rekindle such thoughts. The author reestablishes early American statecraft&#x2019;s understanding of peace&#x2014;what it takes to make it and what it takes to keep it. He reminds Americans why our founding generation placed the pursuit of peace ahead of all other objectives; he shows how they tried to keep the peace by drawing sharp lines between America&#x2019;s business and that of others, as well as between peace and war. He shows how our 20th-century statesmen confused peace and war as well as America&#x2019;s affairs with that of mankind&#x2019;s. The result, he shows, has been endless war abroad and spiraling strife among Americans. Codevilla provides intellectual guidelines for recovering the pursuit of peace as the guiding principle by which the American people and statesmen may navigate domestic as well as international affairs.</p></p><p><p><b>Angelo M.

In January 1939 he took up a short service commission in the RAF and eventually joined 603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadron in December 1939, prior to becoming one of the outstanding fighter pilots of the Battle of Britain, accounting for nearly twenty enemy aircraft destroyed, probably destroyed or damaged. Indeed all his scores were achieved on Spitfires during this Battle and he was revered as one of Richard Hillary's contemporaries in whose book The Last Enemy, he features. <br><br>Nicknamed 'Stapme' after a phrase used in his favorite cartoon 'Just Jake', in February 1942 he became flight commander of 257 Squadron, then joined 2 ADF at Colerne the following year before becoming a gunnery instructor at RAF Kenley and Central Gunnery School, Catfoss. He returned to ops in August 1944 to command 247 Squadron on Typhoons. He received the Dutch Flying Cross for his part in the Arnhem operations. Forced to land inside German lines in December 1944, he spent the rest of the war in Stalag Luft I on the Baltic coast. Postwar he joined BOAC, then returned to South Africa but has now retired to England where he is a very popular figure at numerous air shows during the year. <br><br>Without doubt he was one of the real 'characters' to survive the war and to many the quintessential image of a Battle of Britain fighter pilot. Stapme tells his full story, warts and all, to historian David Ross, whose first book Richard Hillary received acclaim.

At midpoint in the volume, the lecture "What is an author?" fairly describes the project of this series: "Writing unfolds like a game that invariably goes beyond its own rules and transgresses its limits." Each of these pieces is thoroughly self-contained but significant to a greater understanding of both its subject and its author. Wittily, one piece included here is Foucault's pseudonymously authored biographical dictionary entry on himself.

Along the way, Himmelman also unearths a series of surprises&#x2014;about Watergate, and about Bradlee&#x2019;s private relationships with <i>Post</i> owner Katharine Graham, reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and President Kennedy and his wife, Jackie.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t feel that you have to protect me,&#x201d; Bradlee told Himmelman whenever the reporting started to strike close to home. &#x201c;Follow your nose.&#x201d; Those instructions, familiar to any <i>Post</i> reporter, have resulted in this thoughtfully constructed and beautifully written account of a magnetic man whose career has come to define the golden age of newspapers in America, when the press battled for its freedom&#x2014;and won.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Yours in Truth</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;The absolute best nonfiction book of the year . . . a work of journalistic art . . . history straight and true . . . should be required reading at the Columbia School of Journalism.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Surprising and compulsively readable . . .

He lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife and three daughters. &nbsp;<br><br></p>i first met Ben eleven years ago, when I was working as a research assistant for Bob Woodward. One spring night Bob and his wife, Elsa, threw a book party for a friend of theirs and invited me to join them when I knocked off work.<br><br> By the time I finished up, the party was in full swing. I walked out of my third-floor office, past the framed apology from Richard Nixon&#x2019;s press secretary, Ron Ziegler, that Bob keeps at the top of the circular staircase, and then down two swirling flights to the ground floor. The living room, study, and kitchen of the house were jammed with journalists of all stripes and sizes. I had grown up in Washington and should probably have known who everybody was, but I didn&#x2019;t. I was twenty-five years old and green in almost every way, a kid wandering through a grown-up dinner party.<br><br> I took some wine off a tray and looked for a familiar face. After a while I spied Bob standing next to the island in the middle of the kitchen. He was talking with a group of people, one of whom, an older guy, had his hand on Bob&#x2019;s shoulder. They were laughing.<br><br> When I got closer, I realized that the older guy was Ben Bradlee. I may not have known who anybody else at the party was, but I knew who he was. I&#x2019;d seen All the President&#x2019;s Men, and, like most people who saw that movie, I came away with the impression that Ben was the living avatar of old-school journalistic integrity and rough-hewn charm. I&#x2019;d also read his memoir during a slow day or two on the third floor, lingering over the pictures, marveling as much at the stories of women throwing themselves at him in the dimly lit arcades of Paris as at his descriptions of Watergate and the Pentagon Papers.<br><br> Bob always spoke of Ben reverently, respectfully. On rare occasions, which I always enjoyed, he would pause while talking about something we were working on to say what Bradlee might have done in a similar situation. We&#x2019;d usually end up laughing, because a strategically placed &#x201c;fuck&#x201d; was involved most of the time. I was excited to meet him.<br><br> Bob turned, saw me lurking, and when the conversational waters parted he introduced me.<br><br> &#x201c;Hiya!&#x201d; Ben boomed. He was wearing a blazer and a shirt with an open collar, and he had a drink in his hand. As we shook hands, my mind raced back through his memoir, through everything Bob had told me, desperate for some nugget of casual conversational gold that would show him I was worth getting to know. The right phrase would identify me as a young writer of promise, and before long I&#x2019;d be cozied up to the table at one of Ben&#x2019;s legendary dinner parties in Georgetown, sucking down cocktails and lapping my peers.<br><br> That particular bubble burst on contact. Before I could even get &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pleasure to meet you&#x201d; out of my mouth, Ben had turned back to the conversation he&#x2019;d been in before I pulled up. I stuck around for a few minutes, hoping that some fortuitous short circuit might route the conversation back to me, but it didn&#x2019;t. I finished my wine and went home.<br><br> It&#x2019;s odd to me now, how well I remember it: my excitement, the flash of his greeting, the dreamlike feeling that a door had opened and closed before I even knew it was there. I had no idea then that I would ever come to know Ben. But, looking back on it, that first meeting&#x2014;all five seconds of it&#x2014;contained most of the basics. You remember him. He&#x2019;s better-looking than you are. You want to please him. And if you hope to gain or keep his attention, you had better be quick on the draw. Otherwise, as he loves to say, the caravan moves on without you.<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t see Ben again until 2007, when Bob found himself shorthanded for a couple of months and asked if I could help him out. One day he poked his head into my office and told me that he and Elsa had been out for dinner the night before with Ben and his wife, the journalist Sally Quinn, and the topic of Ben doing another book had come up.<br><br> &#x201c;I told them they should hire you,&#x201d; Bob said. &#x201c;You should do it.&#x201d;<br><br> Ten days later, I pulled up in front of Ben and Sally&#x2019;s exquisite home on N Street, in Georgetown, for an interview. The house and grounds take up almost an entire city block. As Evelyn, the maid, led me through the foyer and into the formal dining room, I tried to take in as much as I could without ogling. The phrase &#x201c;Ben and Sally&#x201d; has been synonymous with high Washington society and A-list parties for more than thirty years. The house, particularly the grand ground floor with its large foyer and cavernous living room, looked like a movie set.<br><br> Ben emerged from a door off the den with the remains of that morning&#x2019;s newspaper in his hand, and we all sat down at the table. Sally did most of the talking. Ben&#x2019;s memoir, published in the fall of 1995, had been called A Good Life. As Sally imagined it, this book would be &#x201c;Lessons from a Good Life,&#x201d; filled with short and inspiring stories about Ben&#x2019;s time at The Washington Post interspersed with some words of wisdom from the man himself. She had the entire book mapped out already, down to the cover art.<br><br> &#x201c;Ben&#x2019;s a writer, so of course he wants to write his own book,&#x201d; Sally said at one point, to be sure I knew what the rules were. Ben rolled his eyes.<br><br> Two weeks later, I walked down to the Post building on 15th Street to meet with Ben at his office, on my own. On the phone, Sally had told me how thrilled Ben had been about our interview, how excited he was to get started, that he might huff and puff a little but that really he wanted everything exactly as she had described it to me. I didn&#x2019;t believe her, but I wanted to, so I went.<br><br> Ben&#x2019;s secretary, Carol, picked me up in the lobby and brought me up to Ben&#x2019;s office on the seventh floor. He was tilted back in his chair, reading a newspaper behind a great oval desk. A set of overstuffed bookshelves lined the wall behind him. The far wall, looking out over 15th Street, was set with large windows that let in surprisingly little of the afternoon sun. Carol knocked gently on the open door, and when Ben looked up she led me in and introduced me.<br><br> To say that he had no idea who I was, or what I was doing there, isn&#x2019;t quite true. Carol and Sally had prepped him, so in the most minimal sense he knew. But, basically, he had no idea who I was or what I was doing there. I could tell by how he said hello to me. I took a seat, sweat cooling palpably in my armpits. Carol left the door open and went back out front.<br><br> &#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br> I hadn&#x2019;t been nervous at their house, but now that I was alone with Ben in his element my mouth had somehow become untethered from my brain. I recited the things Sally had told me to say: We can take it slow, I can do some preliminary work and see if it turns into anything, if there&#x2019;s no book there then we won&#x2019;t force it. I have a vague, uncomfortable memory of saying something about what an honor it would be to work with him.<br><br> When I got done, he said simply, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already written one book. I&#x2019;m not in any big rush to write another one.&#x201d;<br><br> I said I understood, which I did. I started to put my notebook away.<br><br> But he wasn&#x2019;t quite ready to kick me out yet. He asked me about my experience with Bob, and as I rattled on about it I hit on something funny and he laughed. The smile that the laugh brought with it completely transformed his face. It was like looking at a different person. His whole face sharpened, came alive. He leaned back in his chair.<br><br> I remember his being immaculately turned out that day: black sweater, gray slacks, shoes that revealed themselves to be leather ankle-zip boots when he put his feet up on the desk, glasses just so, hair swept back in a hard part. He was the most attractive eighty-five-year-old man I&#x2019;d ever seen. Bob once described Ben as &#x201c;Kirk Douglas as a submarine commander,&#x201d; and that&#x2019;s exactly it. His voice sounds like it comes from the bottom of Boston Harbor.<br><br> After a couple of minutes of back-and-forth, Ben mentioned that he had a bunch of boxes in storage someplace but had no idea what was in them.<br><br> &#x201c;Would you like to look at those?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br> It was an opening, a small one. Woodward had vouched for me, and now I had passed some sort of threshold. &#x201c;I would love to look at those,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> &#x201c;Carol knows where they are.&#x201d; He waved his hand, and that was it. He went back to his newspaper, and I saw myself out.<br><br> Ten days later, Carol called to tell me to come back down to the paper. The boxes were coming, and there were a lot of them.</p><h2>On to Oregon!</h2><p>The epic journey of the Sager children by covered wagon from Missouri to Oregon in 1848.</p><p>"Will capture and hold the attention of every boy and girl." -- <i><i>-- Saturday Review</i></i></p><h2>Full-Court Quest: The Girls from Fort Shaw Indian School, Basketball Champions of the World</h2><p><p>Most fans of women&#x2019;s basketball would be startled to learn that girls&#x2019; teams were making their mark more than a century ago&#x2014;and that none was more prominent than a team from an isolated Indian boarding school in Montana.

Boarding schools were established off reservation, as well as on, and government officials actively and aggressively recruited children to attend them. Among the students in the school established at Fort Shaw in Montana were a group of young women who would become famous in Montana, and a popular attraction at the 1904 World's Fair. Their story is told in this well-researched and well-documented book. Leaving their families and arriving at different ages for different reasons, they came together to play the new game of basketball and were quite successful. Peavy and Smith's book is a remarkably rosy picture of an Indian boarding school. While the authors mention that students ran away, that they were separated from their families for long periods of time, and that they were required to speak only English and leave behind traditional dress and culture, these factors seem not to have affected these talented athletes. It is not until the last few pages that the authors specifically, and briefly, address the cost of the success of the girls' team, and the federal Indian educational policy. Still, the book tells a story long forgotten about these "world champions."&#x2014;<i>Mary Ann Harlan, Arcata High School, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He lives in London and Toronto.</p>January 13, 2005, New York<br><br>One problem for the agent trying to sell the stuffed shark was the $12 million asking price for this work of contemporary art.* Another was that it weighed just over two tons, and was not going to be easy to carry home. The taxidermy fifteen-foot tiger shark &#x201c;sculpture&#x201d; was mounted in a giant glass vitrine and creatively named <i>The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living</i>. It is illustrated in the center portion of the book. The shark had been caught in 1991 in Australia, and prepared and mounted in England by technicians working under the direction of British artist Damien Hirst.<br><br>Another concern was that while the shark was certainly a novel artistic concept, many in the art world were uncertain whether it qualified as art. The question was important because $12 million represented more money than had ever been paid for a work by a living artist, other than Jasper Johns &#x2013; more than for a Gerhard Richter, a Robert Rauschenberg, or a Lucian Freud.<br><br>Why would anyone even consider paying this much money for the shark? Part of the answer is that in the world of contemporary art, branding can substitute for critical judgment, and lots of branding was involved here. The seller was Charles Saatchi, an advertising magnate and famous art collector, who fourteen years earlier had commissioned Hirst to produce the work for �50,000. At the time that sum was considered so ridiculous that <i>The Sun </i>heralded the transaction with the headline &#x201c;50,000 For Fish Without Chips.&#x201d; Hirst intended the figure to be an &#x201c;outrageous&#x201d; price, set as much for the publicity it would attract as for the monetary return.<br><br>The agent selling the shark was New York-based Larry Gagosian, the world&#x2019;s most famous art dealer. One buyer known to be actively pursuing the shark was Sir Nicholas Serota, director of London&#x2019;s Tate Modern museum, who had a very constrained budget to work with. Four collectors with much greater financial means had shown moderate interest. The most promising was American Steve Cohen, a very rich Connecticut hedge fund executive. Hirst, Saatchi, Gagosian, Tate, Serota, and Cohen represented more art world branding than is almost ever found in one place. Saatchi&#x2019;s ownership and display of the shark had become a symbol for newspaper writers of the shock art being produced by the group known as the Young British Artists, the yBas. Put the branding and the publicity together and the shark must be art, and the price must not be unreasonable.<br><br>There was another concern, serious enough that with any other purchase it might have deterred buyers. The shark had deteriorated dramatically since it was first unveiled at Saatchi&#x2019;s private gallery in London in 1992. Because the techniques used to preserve it had been inadequate, the original had decomposed until its skin became heavily wrinkled and turned a pale green, a fin had fallen off, and the formaldehyde solution in the tank had turned murky. The intended illusion had been of a tiger shark swimming toward the viewer through the white space of the gallery, hunting for dinner. The illusion now was described as entering Norman Bates&#x2019; fruit cellar and finding Mother embalmed in her chair. Curators at the Saatchi Gallery tried adding bleach to the formaldehyde, but this only hastened the decay. In 1993 the curators gave up and had the shark skinned. The skin was then stretched over a weighted fiberglass mold. The shark was still greenish, still wrinkled.<br><br>Damien Hirst had not actually caught the now-decaying shark. Instead he made &#x201c;Shark Wanted&#x201d; telephone calls to post offices on the Australian coast, which put up posters giving his London number. He paid �6,000 for the shark: �4,000 to catch it and �2,000 to pack it in ice and ship it to London. There was the question of whether Hirst could replace this rotting shark simply by purchasing and stuffing a new one. Many art historians would argue that if refurbished or replaced, the shark became a different artwork. If you overpainted a Renoir, it would not be the same work. But if the shark was a conceptual piece, would catching an equally fierce shark and replacing the original using the same name be acceptable? Dealer Larry Gagosian drew a weak analogy to American installation artist Dan Flavin, who works with fluorescent light tubes. If a tube on a Flavin sculpture burns out, you replace it. Charles Saatchi, when asked if refurbishing the shark would rob it of its meaning as art, responded &#x201c;Completely.&#x201d; So what is more important&#x2013;the original artwork or the artist&#x2019;s intention?<br><br>Nicolas Serota offered Gagosian $2 million on behalf of Tate Modern, but it was turned down. Gagosian continued his sales calls. When alerted that Saatchi intended to sell soon, Cohen agreed to buy.<br><br>Hirst, Saatchi, and Gagosian are profiled later in the book. But who is Steve Cohen? Who pays $12 million for a decaying shark? Cohen is an example of the financial-sector buyer who drives the market in high-end contemporary art. He is the owner of SAC. Capital Advisors, LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut, and is considered a genius. He manages $11 billion in assets and is said to earn $500 million a year. He displays his trophy art in a 32,000 square foot mansion in Greenwich, a 6,000 square foot pied-�-terre in Manhattan, and a 19,000 square foot bungalow in Delray Beach, Florida. In 2007 he purchased a ten bedroom, two acre estate in East Hampton, New York.<br><br>To put the $12 million price tag in context it is necessary to understand how rich really rich is. Assume Mr Cohen has a net worth of $4 billion to go with an annual income of $500 million before tax. At a 10 percent rate of return &#x2013; far less than he actually earns on the assets he manages &#x2013; his total income is just over $16 million a week, or $90,000 an hour. The shark cost him five days&#x2019; income.<br><br>Some journalists later expressed doubt whether the selling price for<i> Physical Impossibility</i> actually was $12 million. Several New York media reported that the only other firm offer aside from that made by Tate Modern came from Cohen, and the actual selling price was $8 million. <i>New York Magazine</i> reported $13 million. But the $12 million figure was the most widely cited, it produced extensive publicity, and the parties agreed not to discuss the amount. At any of these numbers, the sale greatly increased the value of the other Hirst work in the Saatchi collection.<br><br>Cohen was not sure what to do with the shark; it remained stored in England. He said he might donate it to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York &#x2013; which might have led to his being offered a position on the MoMA board. The art world heralded the purchase as a victory for MoMA over London&#x2019;s Tate Modern. London&#x2019;s <i>Guardian</i> newspaper bemoaned the sale to an American, saying: &#x201c;The acquisition will confirm MoMA&#x2019;s dominance as the leading gallery of modern art in the world.&#x201d;<br><br>* * *<br><br>I began the journey of discovery that became this book at the Royal Academy of Arts in London where on October 5, 2006, along with six hundred others, I attended a private preview of <i>USA Today</i>, an exhibition curated by the same Charles Saatchi. This was billed as an exhibition of art by thirty-seven talented young American artists. Many were not in fact American-born, though they were working in New York &#x2013; an illustration of how hard it is to label an artist.<br><br>The Royal Academy is a major British public gallery. Founded in 1768, it promotes its exhibitions as comparable to those at the National Gallery, the two Tate galleries, and leading museums outside the United Kingdom. The <i>USA Today</i> show was not a commercial art fair, because nothing was listed as for sale. Nor was it a traditional museum show, because one man, Charles Saatchi, owned all the work. He chose what was shown. The work would appreciate in value from being shown in such a prestigious public space, and all profit from future sales would accrue to Saatchi.<br><br>Saatchi is neither a professional curator nor museum official. Over a four-decade career he has been both the most talked-about advertising executive of his generation, and later the most talked-about art collector. He is wildly successful in reselling art he has collected at a profit, Damien Hirst&#x2019;s shark being but one example.<br><br>There was criticism of Saatchi both for using the Royal Academy to advance the value of his own art, and because some considered the work decadent or pornographic. The artists present at the opening had no illusions about the nature of the event. One called the Royal Academy the &#x201c;temporary home of the Saatchi Gallery.&#x201d; Another said it was good to see his art on the wall because it might not be displayed again until it was offered at auction.<br><br>Extensive promotion of the show produced huge press coverage. It was hyped pre-opening by every major newspaper in London, by the<i> New York Times</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and a dozen other major U.S. papers. Billed as an exhibition of shocking work, the show included a battle scene involving rats, and an image of a girl performing a sex act on a man.<br><br>The theme of <i>USA Today</i> was billed as disillusionment with contemporary America. Critics and curators at the private opening had diverging opinions of the theme and the work. Some questioned whether the artists could properly be described as disillusioned, or even talented. Norman Rosenthal, the Royal Academy&#x2019;s exhibitions secretary, said the work &#x201c;introduces a sense of political edge and anger mixed with nostalgia; this is an exhibition for our times.&#x201d; Critic Brian Sewell said: &#x201c;At least <i>Sensation</i> [Saatchi&#x2019;s previous exhibition] made me feel nauseous. This made me feel nothing.&#x201d; Ivor Abrahams, a sculptor who sits on the RA exhibitions committee, added: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s schoolboy smut and a cynical ploy to get Saatchi even mo...</p><h2>B-29 Combat Missions</h2><p>Synopsis - B-29 Combat Missions takes the reader through every Superfortress crew position, bringing to life what it was like to fly and fight in the advanced bomber that was credited with bringing World War II to a conclusion earlier than predicted.

Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

Journalist David Harwood is left only with questions after a family outing becomes a terrifying nightmare in the mere blink of an eye.

But those unfamiliar with his work would be wise to clear their calendars for this engaging non-stop thriller. --<i>Dave Callanan</i> <br><br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Linwood Barclay on <i>Never Look Away</i></strong> <br> <p> </p><p>Years ago, when I worked on the city desk for <i>The Toronto Star</i>, every once in a while someone would phone in with a hot tip. Something they&#x2019;d heard from a friend of a friend. The story was that children were being spirited away from a local theme park. Grabbed, disguised, thrown into a van and driven away so fast their parents hadn&#x2019;t even noticed they were gone yet.</p> <p>And the kicker was, the story was being suppressed because the theme park owners didn&#x2019;t want bad publicity.</p> <p>There was never, ever anything to it. I&#x2019;d worked in the news business long enough to know that when a kid goes missing. That story gets out. Big time.</p> <p>Our theme park was not the only one where this urban myth played out. I&#x2019;d heard the same story about a number of big attractions. But never with any real names attached. It always happened to the boyfriend of someone&#x2019;s cousin&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s boss.</p> <p>But the story stayed with me just the same. I started playing around with it in my head. I thought, okay, let&#x2019;s start with the myth, but then let&#x2019;s do something entirely different. Someone&#x2019;s going to disappear, all right, but not the person you&#x2019;re expecting...</p> <p>As I began working out the storyline for my new thriller, <i>Never Look Away</i>, the amusement park scene became a way in to a very different kind of tale for me. One about secrets, about past, hidden lives, about how sometimes the people we&#x2019;re closest to are the ones we know the least. One significant way in which it differs from my previous novels is that it is not told entirely in first person. This time, there were things I had to keep from my protagonist that the reader just had to know.</p> <p>That time on the city desk was part of more than 30 years I spent working in newspapers. It was a period in which papers mattered a great deal. They still do, but it&#x2019;s hardly news to point out they&#x2019;re facing tough times, a perfect storm of changing technology meeting harsh economic realities. So when it came to deciding what that protagonist would do for a living, I decided to make him a reporter at a small daily that&#x2019;s more concerned with maintaining revenues than breaking scandals, especially if breaking them will hurt the bottom line. (I like to point out, I never encountered anything like that at <i>The Star</i>.)</p> <p>I was well into writing this novel when Michael Connelly&#x2019;s terrific novel <i>The Scarecrow</i> came out, which is also set against the backdrop of a newspaper in decline. I suspect these will not be the only two novels to explore--either in depth or in a tangential way--the significant changes this institution is going through. </p> <p>Another urban myth that used to get called into the paper now and again was that some unscrupulous developer was building houses so cheaply, someone&#x2019;s piano went right through the living room floor. We never found that house, but there might still be a murder mystery in that story, especially if there was some poor bastard in that basement. <em>--Linwood Barclay</em></p>Linwood Barclay, a former columnist for the <i>Toronto Star</i>, is the internationally bestselling author of seven critically acclaimed novels, including <b>Fear the Worst, Too Close to Home</b>, and <b>No Time for Goodbye</b>, which has been optioned for film.

Each painting expresses the artist&#x2019;s creative engagement with an incident from the Biblical story and is set next to the Biblical passage that it illustrates. By so doing text and image complement each other. Words give meaning to the image and throw light on its iconography, that is, its use of symbolism. In return the paintings act as commentary, interpreting the text by intensely imagining and visualizing it. At the same time the sequence of illustrations provides a sense of the sweep and propulsion of the Biblical narrative.</p><p></p><h2>Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Complete Newspaper Strips Collection Vol. 3</h2><p>The world's most loyal and long suffering dog, Gromit and his owner and inventor, Wallace are back with another year's worth of pun-tastic, siliness and nonsense filled comic-strip shenanigans!

By failing to seize Gibraltar in the summer of 1940, he lost the war. <br> The Rock of Gibraltar, a pillar of British sea-power since 1704, looked formidable but was extraordinarily vulnerable. Though menaced on all sides by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Vichy France and Francoist Spain, every day Gibraltar had to let thousands of people cross its frontier to work. Among them came spies and saboteurs, eager to blow up its 25 miles of secret tunnels. In 1942, Gibraltar became US General Eisenhower&#x2019;s HQ for the invasion of North Africa, the campaign that led to Allied victory in the Mediterranean. <br> Nicholas Rankin&#x2019;s revelatory new book, whose cast of characters includes Haile Selassie, Anthony Burgess and General Sikorski, sets Gibraltar in the wider context of the struggle against fascism, from Abyssinia through the Spanish Civil War. It also chronicles the end of empire and the rise to independence of the Gibraltarian people.</p><p>Nicholas Rankin worked for 20 years for the BBC World Service, winning two UN awards and becoming Chief Producer. His previous books include biographies of Robert Louis Stevenson and the war-correspondent George Steer, <i>Churchill's Wizards</i>, a study of camouflage, deception and black propaganda in both world wars, and <i>Ian Fleming's Commandos</i>, the history of a WW2 naval intelligence unit. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and lives in London and Kent.</p><h2>The Battle: A New History of Waterloo</h2><p><p>At Waterloo, some 70,000 men under Napoleon and an equal number under Wellington faced one another in a titanic and bloody struggle. In the end, as John Keegan notes, contemporaries felt that Napoleon's defeat had "reversed the tide of European history." Even 190 years later, the name Waterloo resounds. </p><p>Italian historian Alessandro Barbero's majestic new account stands apart from previous British and French histories by giving voice to all the nationalities that took part. Invoking the memories of British, French, and Prussian soldiers, Barbero meticulously re-creates the conflict as it unfolded, from General Reille's early afternoon assault on the chateau of Hougoumont, to the desperate last charge of Napoleon's Imperial Guard as evening settled in. From privates to generals, Barbero recounts individual miracles and tragedies, moments of courage and foolhardiness, skillfully blending them into the larger narrative of the battle's extraordinary ebb and flow. One is left with indelible images: cavalry charges against soldiers formed in squares; the hand-to-hand combat around farmhouses; endless cannon balls and smoke. And, finally, a powerful appreciation of the inevitability and futility of war.</p></p><p><p>ALESSANDRO BARBERO is professor of Medieval History at the University of Piemonte Orientale in Vercelli, Italy. He is the author of <i>Charlemagne: Father of a Continent</i>, and also of several historical novels, one of which, also set in the Napoleonic age, won the Strega Prize, Italy's most distinguished literary award.</p>This new and valuable history of the 1815 French defeat begins with a minimum of background for the non-Napoleonic student, but does superlatively well once Wellington and Napoleon have arrayed their armies for battle (and does not forget the Prussians waiting in the wings). The narrative is unusually accessible, and as experienced readers march on, they will find some novel insights and analyses. For Barbero, cavalry was not on the whole effective, but it could usefully suppress artillery, a welcome change from the usual denigration of everybody's equine forces (even the British are given credit for superior horses). The role of the Prussians, and also of German allied troops in Wellington's ranks, is studied in much more detail than in more Anglocentric accounts, and that many of the Prussians were half-trained militia is emphasized. Finally, Napoleon's army did not go off completely thrashed and in disarray, but substantially maintained order and discipline for several days. The author also does a better job than many popular historians in dealing with factors such as rate of fire, accurate range and the sights, sounds and smells of a Napoleonic battlefield. And while rejecting certain "patriotic myths," he supports the concept of Waterloo as a battle of unusual intensity. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Four and a half decades after the report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women, the feminist struggle is as necessary as ever but thanks to the hard work of activist women, many forms of discrimination are a thing of the past. </p><p>Beginning before the colonization of Canada by European settlers, Penni Mitchell explores gender roles within First Nations societies, where women often brokered peace agreements, oversaw property and advised leaders. She also examines the struggles of First Nations women to challenge Indian Act discrimination against women and children. </p><p>Exploring the early days of colonial settlement, Mitchell notes that women were among Canada s first administrators, and they started its first schools and hospitals. Later, women were among the first to oppose slavery, internment and racial segregation. Demanding a greater say in their country, women fought for the right to vote, attend university and divorce. They fought for child protection laws, public health clinics, minimum wages, equal pay and better working conditions. About Canada: Women s Rights considers the ways in which women s lives have been transformed by the legalization of birth control and abortion and the removal of patriarchal privilege from family law. </p><p> About Canada: Women s Rights introduces readers to some of the many women who changed Canada through their efforts to secure greater equality. While a few are well known, many of these women and the battles they won have been forgotten.

The first full account of how the Cold War arms race finally came to a close, this riveting narrative history sheds new light on the people who struggled to end this era of massive overkill, and examines the legacy of the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that remain a threat today. Drawing on memoirs, interviews in both Russia and the US, and classified documents from deep inside the Kremlin, David Hoffman examines the inner motives and secret decisions of each side and details the deadly stockpiles that remained unsecured as the Soviet Union collapsed. This is the fascinating story of how Reagan, Gorbachev, and a previously unheralded collection of scientists, soldiers, diplomats, and spies changed the course of history.</p><p>David Hoffman is a contributing editor at the Washington Post, where he previously served as White House correspondent, Moscow bureau chief, and assistant managing editor for foreign news.<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;PROLOGUE <br><b>I. Epidemic of Mystery&nbsp;</b><br><br>"Are any of your patients dying?" asked Yakov Klipnitzer when he called Margarita Ilyenko on Wednesday, April 4, 1979. She was chief physician at No. 24, a medium-sized, one-hundred-bed hospital in Sverdlovsk, a Soviet industrial metropolis in the Ural Mountains. Her hospital often referred patients to a larger facility, No. 20, where Klip�nitzer was chief doctor. Klipnitzer saw two unusual deaths from what looked like severe pneumonia. The patients, he told Ilyenko, were "two of yours." No, Ilyenko told him, she did not know of any deaths. The next day he called again. Klipnitzer was more persistent. "You still don't have any patients dying?" he asked. Klipnitzer had new deaths with pneumonia-like symptoms. "Who is dying from pneumonia today?" Ilyenko replied, incredulous. "It is very rare." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, patients began to die at Ilyenko's hospital, too. They were brought in ambulances and cars, suffering from high fevers, headaches, coughs, vomiting, chills and chest pains. They were stumbling in the hall�ways and lying on gurneys. The head of admissions at Hospital No. 20, Roza Gaziyeva, was on duty overnight between April 5 and 6. "Some of them who felt better after first aid tried to go home. They were later found on the streets&#x2014;the people had lost consciousness," she recalled. She tried to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to one ill patient, who died. "During the night, we had four people die. I could hardly wait until morning. I was frightened." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of April 6, Ilyenko raced to the hospital, threw her bag into her office, put on her white gown and headed for the ward. One patient looked up at her, eyes open, and then died. "There are dead bod�ies, people still alive, lying together. I thought, this is a nightmare. Some�thing is very, very wrong." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Death came quickly to victims. Ilyenko reported to the district public health board that she had an emergency. Instructions came back to her that another hospital, No. 40, was being set up to receive all the patients in an infectious disease ward. The word spread&#x2014;<i>infection!</i>&#x2014;and with it, fear. Some staff refused to report for work, and others already at work refused to go home so as not to expose their families. Then, disinfection workers arrived at hospital No. 20, wearing hazardous materials suits. They spread chlorine everywhere, which was a standard disinfectant, but the scene was terrifying, Ilyenko recalled. "There was panic when people saw them."(1) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sverdlovsk, population 1.2 million, was the tenth-largest city in the Soviet Union and the heartland of its military-industrial complex. Guns, steel, industry and some of the best mechanical engineering schools in the Soviet Union were Sverdlovsk's legacy from Stalin's rush to modernize during World War II and after. Since 1976, the region had been run by a young, ambitious party secretary, Boris Yeltsin. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospitals No. 20 and 24 were in the southern end of the city, which slopes downward from the center. Streets lined with small wooden cot�tages and high fences were broken up by stark five-story apartment buildings, shops and schools. The Chkalovsky district, where Ilyenko's hospital was located, included a ceramics factory where hundreds of men worked in shifts in a cavernous building with large, high windows. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than a mile away, to the north-northwest, was Compound 32, an army base for two tank divisions, largely residences, and, adjacent to it, a closed military microbiology facility. Compound 19, which comprised a laboratory, development and testing center for deadly pathogens, includ�ing anthrax, was run by the 15th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense. On Monday April 2, 1979, from morning until early evening, the wind was blowing down from Compound 19 toward the ceramics factory.(2)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Inside Compound 19, three shifts operated around the clock, experiment�ing with anthrax and making it in batches. Anthrax bacteria were grown in fermentation vessels, separated from the liquid growth medium and dried before they were ground up into a fine powder for use in aerosol form. Workers at the compound were regularly given vaccinations. The work was high risk. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anthrax is an often-fatal infection that occurs when spores of the bac�teria <i>Bacillus anthracis </i>enter the body, either through the skin, ingestion or inhalation. The bacteria germinate and release toxins that can quickly bring on death if untreated. In Russia, the disease was known as <i>Sibirskaya yazva</i>, or Siberian ulcer, because of the black sores that form when it is contracted through cuts in the skin. In nature, the disease most commonly spreads through contact with infected animals, usually graz�ing animals such as cows, goats and sheep, which ingest the spores from the soil. The inhalation variety is dangerous to humans. Breathing the spores into the lungs can kill those infected if not treated. A single gram of anthrax contains around a trillion spores. Odorless and colorless, the spores are extremely stable, and can remain dormant for as long as fifty years or more. For these reasons, anthrax was well suited for a biological weapon. According to one estimate, 112 pounds of anthrax spores released along a 1.2-mile line upwind of a city of 500,000 residents would result in 125,000 infections&#x2014;and kill 95,000 people.(3)<br>What exactly happened at Compound 19 is still unknown. By one account, a filter was removed and not properly replaced, and anthrax spores were released into the air.(4) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the south, sheep and cattle in villages began to die. Anthrax had been present in rural areas in the past, although it was not common. At the same time, people started getting sick. The first records of those admitted to hospitals came on Wednesday, April 4, when Ilyenko got Klipnitzer's phone call. "What was strange for us, it was mainly men dying, not many women, and not a single child," she said.(5) Ilyenko began keeping records of names, ages, addresses and possible reasons for the deaths, but she didn't know what was happening, or why. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On April 10, as the crisis deepened, Faina Abramova, a retired pathol�ogist who had been a lecturer at the Sverdlovsk Medical Institute, was summoned to Hospital No. 40 and asked to autopsy a thirty-seven-year�old man who died over the weekend. He had been at Compound 32, the army base with the tank divisions, for reserve duty, gone home to a nearby village and, for no apparent reason, became suddenly ill. Abram �ova, a spirited professional, was puzzled by the case. The man did not show classic signs of influenza and pneumonia. But the autopsy showed infection of the lymph nodes and the lungs. Abramova had also noticed the man suffered from cerebral bleeding, a distinctive red ring around the brain known as "cardinal's cap."(6) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We started thinking what other diseases may cause this pathology," she recalled. "We looked up the books, and we went through them all together, and it looked like anthrax." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That evening, Abramova attended a reception, which was also attended by Lev Grinberg, her prot�g�, a young pathologist with thick glasses, black hair and a beard. As they danced at the reception, Abramova whispered to him that she had autopsied the man earlier that day, and diagnosed his death as anthrax. Grinberg was stunned. "I asked, where in our godforsaken Sverdlovsk can we have anthrax?" he recalled. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, Grinberg saw the evidence for himself. He was instructed to go to Ilyenko's hospital. "I saw a horrible picture," he recalled. "It was three women, they had identical changes, sharp hemor�rhagic changes in their lungs, in the lymph nodes, and the tissue of lymph nodes was hemorrhaging." Abramova took samples and materials from the autopsies. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Word of the outbreak reached Moscow. Late on April 11, Vladimir Nikiforov, a chief of the infectious diseases department at the Central Postgraduate Institute, located within the Botkin Hospital in Moscow, arrived in Sverdlovsk. Also arriving in the city was Pyotr Burgasov, the Soviet deputy minister of health, who had once worked at Compound 19, in the 1950s. On April 12, at 2 P.M., Nikiforov assembled all the doctors who had been involved and asked for their observations and the autop�sies. Abramova was last to speak. She told him: anthrax. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nikiforov, an eminent, courtly scientist who had studied anthrax throughout his career, announced that he agreed with her. He reassured the doctors it could not spread from human to human. But from where had it come? Burgasov declared the source was contaminated meat from a village located 9.3 miles from the city. No one spoke up. No one knew for sure; the uncertainty was frightening. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Chkalovsky's neighborhoods, residents were told to watch out for contaminated meat. A widespread vaccination program began; accord�ing to Ilyenko's notes, 42,065 people were vaccinated in the days that fol�lowed. Broadsheet leaflets dated April 18 were distributed warning people not to buy meat outside the stores, to watch out for anthrax symp�toms such as headaches, fever, cold and cough followed by abdominal pains and high temperatures, and not to slaughter animals without per�mission.(7) Buildings and trees were washed by local fire brigades, stray dogs shot by police and unpaved streets covered with fresh asphalt. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ilyenko wrote in her notes on April 20, "358 got sick. 45 died. 214 in Hospital 40." She was not asked to relinquish her notes, and kept them at home. The 45 who died at her hospital were only...</p></p><h2>Vineyard Blues: A Martha&#39;s Vineyard Mystery (A Martha&#39;s Vineyard Mystery, 11)</h2><p><p>A surprise visit from a dear old friend only adds to the joys of good weather, great fishing, warm breezes and loving family for J. W. Jackson this idyllic island summer. The ex-Boston cop is thrilled to see accomplished bluesman Corrie Appleyard strolling up his driveway, guitar case in hand. But days later, J.W.'s elation turns to dread when a rundown summer shack burns to the ground -- the latest in a string of suspicious fires. And when an unidentified corpse is discovered in the ashes, J. W. fears that the charred remains are Corrie's. Now twin obligations to friendship and the truth are leading him into an ugly morass of arson, extortion, secrets, and murder. And he'll go to the dangerous ends of paradise to bring a killer to justice -- because this outrage has slammed J. W. Jackson in the heart.</p></p><p>You can almost taste the freshly caught bluefish and smell the tangy salt air in Philip Craig's newest Martha's Vineyard mystery, a seasonal delight featuring former Boston policeman J.W. Jackson. J.W. hasn't seen legendary bluesman Corrie Appleyard since he was a child, and when Corrie arrives on the Vineyard for a rare concert appearance, J.W. couldn't be happier. It's almost enough to take his mind off the series of arson fires that have destroyed the dilapidated summer cottages that a local slumlord rents out at outrageously high prices to college kids who've come to work and play in the famous summer colony. But when Corrie's precious guitar is found at the site of the latest fire, and an unidentified body is pulled from the ruins, J.W. fears the worst.<p> Although he's already busy trying to track down a blackmailer who's been threatening Susanna Quick, his wife Zee's close friend, J.W. agrees to investigate the arson fires for the owner of the cottages, which leads him into still another unsolved mystery: why is Zee so opposed to his newest client? By the time the connection between the arsonist, the slumlord, Susanna, and Zee is unraveled in a surprising denouement, you'll have worked up an appetite. Luckily, the author has included the recipes of Vineyard favorites at the end of this tasty mystery. J.W. is an extremely appealing hero, a man of simple pleasures who's not averse to putting himself on the line to defend his wife, his family, and his close-knit community of friends and neighbors . The pacing won't keep you from a nap after a day of sun and salt water, but the book moves along nicely, the Vineyard landscape is lovingly and authentically evoked, and the characters are well drawn. <i>Vineyard Blues</i> is another satisfying outing for this accomplished writer (who also brought us <i>A Fatal Vineyard Season</i>, <i>A Shoot on Martha's Vineyard</i>, <i>Death on a Vineyard Beach</i>) and his likable protagonist. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><p>Philip R.

In this book a distinguished biologist, long intrigued by the secret life of fungi, reveals the power of these curious organisms--not quite animal, not quite plant--to enchant and instruct, to nourish and make way for all sorts of superior forms of nature. </p><p> In a style at once learned and quirky, personal and commanding, Elio Schaechter imparts the fascinating minutiae and the weighty implications of his subject--a primarily microscopic life form that nonetheless accounts for up to two tons of matter for every human on the planet. He shows us how fungi, the great decomposers, recycle most of the world's vegetable matter--from a blade of grass to a strapping tree--and thus prevent us from sinking under ever-accumulating masses of decaying matter. </p><p> With the same expertise and contagious enthusiasm that he brings to the biology of mushrooms, Schaechter conveys the allure of the mushroom hunt. Drawing on his own experience as well as that of seasoned pickers and amateur mycologists, he explains when and where to find mushrooms, how they are cultivated, and how they are used in various cultures. From the delectable to the merely tolerable, from the hallucinogenic to the deadly, a wide variety of mushrooms are covered in this spirited presentation. </p></p><p>Call them the foot soldiers of the forest floor. Unassuming and prolific, mushrooms clear a path for new life by expertly and efficiently recycling accumulated dead matter, from the tiniest leaf to the tallest tree. It may sound like a dirty, thankless job, but as microbiologist and author Elio Schaechter enthusiastically notes, we should be singing praises to the fungi of the Earth; without them, all but the tallest of creatures would be buried under a global blanket of decomposing matter. Schaechter is obviously fascinated by his subject, and his spirit is contagious, making <i>In the Company of Mushrooms</i> as entertaining as it is informative. Though the book serves as a guide to hunting, identifying, and classifying mushrooms--including where to look, what tools are necessary, and how to discern the flavorful from the deadly--its primary aim is to convey the wonders of the fungi world and its essential function in nature. Along the way Schaechter discusses the history of the mushroom and its role in the diets and healing practices of both ancient and modern cultures. He also offers such delectable tidbits as the fact that fungi are more closely related to humans than plants on the evolutionary scale. Mycology has never been so engaging.<b>Elio Schaechter</b> is Distinguished Professor of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Emeritus, Tufts University School of Medicine.

He and his sturdiest search-and-rescue dog, Bolo, get to work immediately, but the scene is rife with danger: continued rainfall prevents the rescue teams from stabilizing the land; toxic household substances spread by the crushing slide fill the area with hazardous waste; and the detritus and debris are treacherous for both man and dog to navigate. But most perilous are the secrets hidden under the mud and sludge&#x2014;secrets someone would kill to protect. For this is no ordinary rescue mission.

He&#x2019;d spent two tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He&#x2019;d been shot at, dodged IEDs, and escaped a grenade. But needles &#x2013; damn, he hated needles.<br> &#x201c;This will help relax you,&#x201d; Dr. Shaw told him. <br> When she walked in the door Tate had been relieved to see a woman. But she had barely introduced herself before she pulled out a stainless steel tray with vials and surgical utensils and, of course, several syringes. Her black hair was pulled back tight leaving only long bangs that overlapped heavy-framed glasses. She was younger than he expected, with smooth skin that hadn&#x2019;t yet earned wrinkles at the corners of her mouth or eyes. And she was attractive, but instead of looking at her now, Tate let his eyes scan the room. He didn&#x2019;t want to even see the needle, so he stared at the walls. <br> It was a strange room, empty except for the examination table. The drywall looked spongy, like the foam mats you&#x2019;d find at the basketball court tacked up under the basket for overenthusiastic athletes to bounce off of.

Tate&#x2019;s chance of backing out had passed. He knew it as soon as he signed on page seven of that long-ass contract they&#x2019;d handed him when he first arrived. <br> He didn&#x2019;t even know where this place was. It had been pouring sheets of rain the entire hour and a half from the airport. That was yesterday, or at least he thought it was. His wristwatch and cellphone were two of the personal items he had to surrender. Other than not knowing the time of day, he didn&#x2019;t mind. But Tate didn&#x2019;t understand why he couldn&#x2019;t wear his own shoes or underwear. The blue scrubs were comfortable, but the paper booties drove him crazy. He felt like he was shuffling, the sound reminding him of the old people in the nursing home where his wife worked.<br> &#x201c;After I administer the drug I&#x2019;ll ask you a series of questions,&#x201d; Dr. Shaw said.<br> He glanced at her and held back a grimace. She was loading another syringe. Long, slender fingers with blood-red nail polish. A ring on her thumb &#x2013; that was strange, but young women did that, right? The ring had tiny little diamonds dancing around the band. All Tate could think was that this served him right for not reading all seven pages. He&#x2019;d only cared about the three thousand dollars he had been promised, and he had double checked that it was in the contract. <br> He hated that his wife worked an extra shift once a week just to make ends meet. Their oldest daughter had started waiting tables at the coffee shop. Even Danny Junior had a paper route. But Tate hadn&#x2019;t been able to get a job. <br> <i>Not true.</i> He hadn&#x2019;t been able to <i>hold </i>a job since he&#x2019;d been back. <br> The doctors called it post-traumatic stress disorder. But all Tate saw when he looked in the mirror was a perfectly healthy man. Never mind that his brain twisted pieces of information, and insomnia kept him pacing the streets of their small town. He needed to start contributing and helping to take care of his family. Even if it meant a few needle pokes.<br> This time it didn&#x2019;t matter where he looked. As soon as the metal slipped into his vein he felt the liquid rush into his body. A heat wave crawled up his arm, over his shoulder, and spread throughout his chest. It took his breath away, and he felt his body shudder.<br> &#x201c;You may experience a tightness in your chest,&#x201d; he heard Dr. Shaw say. Only now it sounded like she was talking to him from the next room.<br> He turned his head to look at her and just that movement made him nauseated. He tried to find her eyes through the blur. The small rose tattoo he had noticed earlier on the side of her neck had grown legs and started to inch along her skin like an insect. Tate blinked hard, trying to focus. Sweat beaded on his forehead and upper lip.<br> &#x201c;Nose bleeds are not uncommon,&#x201d; Dr. Shaw continued in her calm, cool manner. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to ask you some questions, Daniel.&#x201d;<br> <i>Tate,</i> he wanted to tell her everyone called him Tate, but he couldn&#x2019;t take his mind off the bug digging into her neck. His heart galloped in his chest and it was difficult to breathe.<br> &#x201c;Daniel, can you count backward from a hundred for me?&#x201d;<br> His mouth had a metallic taste and it took effort to make it move. Teeth and tongue seemed to be in the way of him activating his voice. <br> &#x201c;Daniel, can you count backward from a hundred?&#x201d; she repeated.<br> Suddenly he heard himself say, &#x201c;That would be difficult to do because I don&#x2019;t like rice.&#x201d;<br> Even as he said it he knew it wasn&#x2019;t the correct answer, but already he&#x2019;d forgotten the question. Nothing mattered except the black insect on her neck. Why couldn&#x2019;t she feel it digging under her skin?<br> &#x201c;Dr. Shaw.&#x201d; A voice called from the doorway.<br> Tate&#x2019;s entire body jerked before he saw the man. His head was shaved and gleamed almost as bright as his long white coat. Tate had to look away. The brightness hurt his eyes. Just as they were starting to focus, the light sent stars and sparks like electrical surges and he knew he couldn&#x2019;t trust them.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the middle of a test,&#x201d; Dr. Shaw told the man.<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s gotten worse.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Can you please wait a few minutes, Richard? I&#x2019;ve just started.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;For god&#x2019;s sake, you didn&#x2019;t give him the serum, did you? It takes seventy-two hours to leave the system. And we need to leave now.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Calm down, please.&#x201d;<br> Tate couldn&#x2019;t decide if she was talking to him or the man, because she was staring directly at him. <br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re talking about landslides. We really must evacuate.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lived through hurricanes, Richard. This is just a rain.&#x201d;<br> But now she left Tate and joined the man at the door. Neither bothered to keep their voices down. In fact, they seemed to forget about Tate. They didn&#x2019;t even notice that he was panting now and wiping erratically at his eyes, sweat pouring down his face.<br> &#x201c;The water is almost over the bridge.&#x201d; Richard sounded panicked. He was loud and gesturing. &#x201c;If we don&#x2019;t leave now, we risk being stranded here.&#x201d;<br> Dr. Shaw was turned away from him and Tate could no longer see the insect on her neck. He began checking his own hands and arms.&nbsp; <br> &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t just leave behind all of our research material. We&#x2019;re safe here,&#x201d; Dr. Shaw was telling the man. &#x201c;This place is built like a fortress.&#x201d;<br> Tate tried to see if there were any bugs on the man. His eyes were finally settling down when he saw a flash of green and black fur behind the doctors. It looked like a small monkey running up the hallway.<br> &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m leaving. With or without you.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That would be a mistake. Let&#x2019;s talk about this.&#x201d; She glanced over her shoulder, and when she called out to Tate it sounded like a bellow echoing across the small room, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back, Daniel. Stay right here.&#x201d;<br> She joined the man in the hallway and tried to close the door. When it didn&#x2019;t seem to fit the frame, she opened it wide. <br> &#x201c;See, that&#x2019;s not a good sign,&#x201d; Richard told her. &#x201c;Doors and windows tend to stick right before. It&#x2019;s bad, I&#x2019;m telling you. We must leave.&#x201d;<br> This time she pulled the door with such force it slammed. <br> Tate sat listening to the thump-thump of his heart. It was beating inside his head, and he put his hands over his chest to make sure his heart hadn&#x2019;t moved. He wasn&#x2019;t sure how much time had passed since the doctors had left. It could have been minutes. It could have been an hour. Then a loud crack jolted him off the table. <br> It sounded like an artillery shell.&nbsp; Was that possible?<br> He crawled under the examination table, his body scrambling in twitches and jerks. He listened for more artillery shells. The room started to sway and tilt. Was it the drug? Had it screwed with his equilibrium? His ears popped, and instead of the thumping of his heart, he now heard only a rumble. <br> He felt it, too. A vibration rattled the doctor&#x2019;s instruments, shaking them off the tray. The floor tiles lifted and rolled beneath him, and Tate grabbed onto the examination table.<br> That&#x2019;s when he saw the whitewashed walls crack and buckle. They were actually caving in as if a bulldozer was on the other side shoving them in. Tate felt something coming down from the ceiling. He ducked his head back under the table. He watched, not sure whether to believe his eyes. It was raining dirt and gravel. He could smell the wet earth. <br> The rumble grew to a roar. Forget the bulldozer, a freight train was headed down on top of him. He covered his head with his arms and curled into a tight ball. <br> More crashes. Metal shrieked. Light fixtures exploded. <br> In the darkness Daniel Tate couldn&#x2019;t see. The floor became a rollercoaster. He clawed to hold onto the steel table as the world shattered and roared and collapsed on top of him. <br> <b><br><br>Chapter 2</b><br> Florida Panhandle<br> &nbsp;<br> Ryder Creed had been up for two hours by the time his hired man climbed out of the doublewide trailer. Truth was, Creed didn&#x2019;t sleep much. He&#x2019;d awakened in the dark and found himself down in the kennel curled up in the middle of his dogs, his head on the belly of his oldest, Rufus. <br> The kennel was a contemporary warehouse. Creed had a loft apartment above it with all the luxuries and comforts of a retreat. When he designed the place he convinced his business partner, Hannah Washington, that he wanted his living quarters above the kennel so he could keep an eye and ear on the most prized possessions of their business, K9 CrimeScents. <br> Actually Creed just liked being near the dogs. Sometimes in the dead of night when visions and images haunted his sleep, he found comfort being surrounded by them. He and Hannah had rescued each and every dog in one fashion or another. But Creed knew they rescued him in a way he could not explain to anyone. Not even Hannah. <br> Now he watched Jason Seaver wiping the sleep out of his eyes. As he made his way into the kennel, Creed realized how much Jason looked like a young boy. Almost ten years younger than Creed, Jason had seen his world blown up on him before he had reached twenty. The kid was one of Hannah&#x2019;s rescues. She said Jason reminded her of Creed and that was one of the reasons she hired the young man. <br> Tucked under Jason&#x2019;s arm was his sleepy-eyed, black puppy. In less than a month the Labrador pup Jason had named Scout had almost doubled in size. He brought Scout to play with the dog&#x2019;s mom and siblings while Jason worked. This morning he put the puppy down on the ground before he got to the yard.<br> &#x201c;Watch this,&#x201d; he told Creed as he walked three paces back, then kneeled on the ground facing the pup. &#x201c;Come on Scout. Come give me a kiss.&#x201d;<br> The puppy wiggled his entire back end, almost losing balance in his excitement. He bounced toward Jason and without hesitation stood up on his hind legs, reaching for Jason&#x2019;s face and planting a big slobber right on the lips.<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll come in handy when he&#x2019;s searching for cadavers,&#x201d; Creed said, but he couldn&#x2019;t help smiling.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking chick magnet.&#x201d;<br> Jason picked up Scout, and when he came inside yard the other dogs ran to greet him. They shoved and nudged each other out of the way for Jason&#x2019;s attention. None of them noticed or cared that one of the kid&#x2019;s shirt sleeves hung empty below the elbow. When Creed had first met the young veteran he had been belligerent and moody, self-conscious about the amputated arm to the point of daring anyone and everyone to notice it. That the kid was thinking about picking up women&#x2014;even with the lousy trick of using his puppy&#x2014;had to be a good sign.<br> Now if only Creed could make a decent dog handler out of him.<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re ready to use the real stuff today,&#x201d; he told Jason and held up a Mason jar with the lid tight over the contents.<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s inside?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Some dirt and a piece of a blanket. Both were underneath a dead body.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Cool. How&#x2019;d you get it?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Grace and I helped find the guy. Wasn&#x2019;t a homicide so the detectives let me have a few things for training.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Andy claims you have a whole stockpile.&#x201d;<br> Andy was one of the first handlers Creed had trained. At the time she&#x2019;d known more about dogs than Creed, having spent years as a veterinary technician. This was a second career for her. He knew better than to ask a woman&#x2019;s age, but guessed Andy was somewhere in her forties.<br> &#x201c;Yeah? Well, don&#x2019;t believe everything Andy tells you. Here, take this.&#x201d; And he tossed the Mason jar, realizing too late that maybe Jason couldn&#x2019;t do a one-handed catch. But the kid had no problem. <br> &#x201c;Take it and hide it good.&#x201d; Creed pointed to the trail that led into the forest. &#x201c;Just before you hide it, remove the lid. There&#x2019;s a cheesecloth stretched across the top. Leave that on.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You want me to bury it?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Bury it, throw it up in a tree, drop it in the creek, do whatever you want with it. Don&#x2019;t think about it too much. When you finish, come on back.&#x201d;<br> The fifty-acre property was surrounded on three sides by forest. The privacy and seclusion it afforded them was one of the reasons Creed chose this place in the northern part of the Florida Panhandle. It also provided endless training ground.<br> His cell phone started to vibrate as he watched Jason disappear into the woods. He glanced at the screen to see it was Hannah. Less than an hour ago they&#x2019;d had coffee and Hannah&#x2019;s fresh-baked cinnamon rolls in her kitchen.<br> &#x201c;Already miss me?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I ought to feed you sugar more often in the morning, you gonna be this sweet.&#x201d; Then without missing a beat she went on to business. &#x201c;Landslide in North Carolina. Some man from the DoD. We got a request for you specifically.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Me or Grace?&#x201d;<br> Over the summer there had been a lot of media attention, most of it centered on Grace, their amazing Jack Russell terrier. The scrappy little dog had won the hearts of the nation when she helped make several drug busts and stopped one human trafficking incident, resulting in the rescue of five children.<br> &#x201c;Actually you. No specific dog.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;When did the slide happen? Are we talking rescue or recovery?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Late last night into this morning. It&#x2019;s still raining and from what I understand, there&#x2019;s still potential for more slides. Possible rescues. Definitely recovery.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need to leave right away. What is that? A five-hour drive? Can you come finish with Jason?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Already putting on my dungarees.&#x201d;<br> That made Creed smile. Hannah was the only person he knew who referred to blue jeans as dungarees. She&#x2019;d hate it if he called her a southern belle, though her mannerisms sometimes fit. She would say she was cornbread and black-eyed peas and certainly not a lady who lunched.<br> &#x201c;But no need to drive,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re sending a jet. A Gulfstream 550.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re sending what?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I know I got it right. I wrote it down. Gulfstream 550. That&#x2019;s one of the pretty ones, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Wait a minute. I thought you said the request was from the Department of Defense.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What interest do they have in a landslide in North Carolina?&#x201d; Creed didn&#x2019;t like the sounds of this. <br> &#x201c;That is not on my list of questions. Maybe they had some training pers...</p><h2>Paddy Whacked: The Untold Story of the Irish American Gangster</h2><p>Here is the shocking true saga of the Irish American mob. In Paddy Whacked, bestselling author and organized crime expert T. J. English brings to life nearly two centuries of Irish American gangsterism, which spawned such unforgettable characters as Mike &#34;King Mike&#34; McDonald, Chicago&#39;s subterranean godfather; Big Bill Dwyer, New York&#39;s most notorious rumrunner during Prohibition; Mickey Featherstone, troubled Vietnam vet turned Westies gang leader; and James &#34;Whitey&#34; Bulger, the ruthless and untouchable Southie legend. Stretching from the earliest New York and New Orleans street wars through decades of bootlegging scams, union strikes, gang wars, and FBI investigations, Paddy Whacked is a riveting tour de force that restores the Irish American gangster to his rightful preeminent place in our criminal history -- and penetrates to the heart of the American experience.</p><p></p><h2>Scott 2009 Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue, Vol. 1: United States and Affiliated Territories, United Nations, Countries of the World- A-B</h2><p>More than 58,000 value changes have been recorded in Volume 1. The large number of changes is the result of both strong overseas markets and worldwide currency fluctuations that have seen the U.S. dollar drop against other strong currencies. Almost 4,700 value changes were made in the United States, U.S. possessions and United Nations sections of Volume 1, and almost all the value changes in the U.S. section are upward.

The Osborns have conducted mass crusades in over 70 nations, preaching to audiences ranging from 20,000 to 250,000 nightly and more. They have sponsored over 25,000 national preachers as full-time missionaries, reaching their own unreached tribes and villages. They have published gospel literature in 132 languages and dialects. They have produced documentary films and crusade tapes for public evangelism in nearly 80 major languages. They have provided airlifts and huge shipments of soulwinning tools for gospel missions and workers worldwide. They have furnished vehicles with films, projectors, screens, generators, P.A. systems, audio cassettes and cassette players, and great quantities of literature for evangelism abroad. </p><p>They are energetic and prolific writers.

Though it was beautiful, I grew to hate this table. It was long and skinny, like one of those things you&#x2019;d see in a comedy sketch about an old wealthy couple that sits down for dinner&#x2014;�one person at either end, a candelabra in the middle&#x2014;�and has to shout to make conversation. The table had been chosen by a designer Steve Jobs liked, and it was elegant, all right&#x2014;�but it impeded our work.<br><br>We&#x2019;d hold regular meetings about our movies around that table&#x2014;�thirty of us facing off in two long lines, often with more people seated along the walls&#x2014;�and everyone was so spread out that it was difficult to communicate. For those unlucky enough to be seated at the far ends, ideas didn&#x2019;t flow because it was nearly impossible to make eye contact without craning your neck. Moreover, because it was important that the director and producer of the film in question be able to hear what everyone was saying, they had to be placed at the center of the table. So did Pixar&#x2019;s creative leaders: John Lasseter, Pixar&#x2019;s creative officer, and me, and a handful of our most experienced directors, producers, and writers. To ensure that these people were always seated together, someone began making place cards. We might as well have been at a formal dinner party.<br><br>When it comes to creative inspiration, job titles and hierarchy are meaningless. That&#x2019;s what I believe. But unwittingly, we were allowing this table&#x2014;�and the resulting place card ritual&#x2014;�to send a different message. The closer you were seated to the middle of the table, it implied, the more important&#x2014;�the more central&#x2014;�you must be. And the farther away, the less likely you were to speak up&#x2014;�your distance from the heart of the conversation made participating feel intrusive. If the table was crowded, as it often was, still more people would sit in chairs around the edges of the room, creating yet a third tier of participants (those at the center of the table, those at the ends, and those not at the table at all). Without intending to, we&#x2019;d created an obstacle that discouraged people from jumping in.<br><br>Over the course of a decade, we held countless meetings around this table in this way&#x2014;�completely unaware of how doing so undermined our own core principles. Why were we blind to this? Because the seating arrangements and place cards were designed for the convenience of the leaders, including me. Sincerely believing that we were in an inclusive meeting, we saw nothing amiss because we didn&#x2019;t feel excluded. Those not sitting at the center of the table, meanwhile, saw quite clearly how it established a pecking order but presumed that we&#x2014;�the leaders&#x2014;�had intended that outcome. Who were they, then, to complain?<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t until we happened to have a meeting in a smaller room with a square table that John and I realized what was wrong. Sitting around that table, the interplay was better, the exchange of ideas more free-�flowing, the eye contact automatic. Every person there, no matter their job title, felt free to speak up. This was not only what we wanted, it was a fundamental Pixar belief: Unhindered communication was key, no matter what your position. At our long, skinny table, comfortable in our middle seats, we had utterly failed to recognize that we were behaving contrary to that basic tenet. Over time, we&#x2019;d fallen into a trap. Even though we were conscious that a room&#x2019;s dynamics are critical to any good discussion, even though we believed that we were constantly on the lookout for problems, our vantage point blinded us to what was right before our eyes.<br><br>Emboldened by this new insight, I went to our facilities department. &#x201c;Please,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care how you do it, but get that table out of there.&#x201d; I wanted something that could be arranged into a more intimate square, so people could address each other directly and not feel like they didn&#x2019;t matter. A few days later, as a critical meeting on an upcoming movie approached, our new table was installed, solving the problem.<br><br>Still, interestingly, there were remnants of that problem that did not immediately vanish just because we&#x2019;d solved it. For example, the next time I walked into West One, I saw the brand-�new table, arranged&#x2014;�as requested&#x2014;�in a more intimate square that made it possible for more people to interact at once. But the table was adorned with the same old place cards! While we&#x2019;d fixed the key problem that had made place cards seem necessary, the cards themselves had become a tradition that would continue until we specifically dismantled it. This wasn&#x2019;t as troubling an issue as the table itself, but it was something we had to address because cards implied hierarchy, and that was precisely what we were trying to avoid. When Andrew Stanton, one of our directors, entered the meeting room that morning, he grabbed several place cards and began randomly moving them around, narrating as he went. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need these anymore!&#x201d; he said in a way that everyone in the room grasped. Only then did we succeed in eliminating this ancillary problem.<br><br>This is the nature of management. Decisions are made, usually for good reasons, which in turn prompt other decisions. So when problems arise&#x2014;�and they always do&#x2014;�disentangling them is not as simple as correcting the original error. Often, finding a solution is a multi-�step endeavor. There is the problem you know you are trying to solve&#x2014;�think of that as an oak tree&#x2014;�and then there are all the other problems&#x2014;�think of these as saplings&#x2014;�that sprouted from the acorns that fell around it. And these problems remain after you cut the oak tree down.<br><br>Even after all these years, I&#x2019;m often surprised to find problems that have existed right in front of me, in plain sight. For me, the key to solving these problems is finding ways to see what&#x2019;s working and what isn&#x2019;t, which sounds a lot simpler than it is. Pixar today is managed according to this principle, but in a way I&#x2019;ve been searching all my life for better ways of seeing. It began decades before Pixar even existed.<br><br>When I was a kid, I used to plunk myself down on the living room floor of my family&#x2019;s modest Salt Lake City home a few minutes before 7 p.m. every Sunday and wait for Walt Disney. Specifically, I&#x2019;d wait for him to appear on our black-�and-�white RCA with its tiny 12-�inch screen. Even from a dozen feet away&#x2014;�the accepted wisdom at the time was that viewers should put one foot between them and the TV for every inch of screen&#x2014;�I was transfixed by what I saw.<br><br>Each week, Walt Disney himself opened the broadcast of The Wonderful World of Disney. Standing before me in suit and tie, like a kindly neighbor, he would demystify the Disney magic. He&#x2019;d explain the use of synchronized sound in Steamboat Willie or talk about the importance of music in Fantasia. He always went out of his way to give credit to his forebears, the men&#x2014;�and, at this point, they were all men&#x2014;�who&#x2019;d done the pioneering work upon which he was building his empire. He&#x2019;d introduce the television audience to trailblazers such as Max Fleischer, of Koko the Clown and Betty Boop fame, and Winsor McCay, who made Gertie the Dinosaur&#x2014;�the first animated film to feature a character that expressed emotion&#x2014;�in 1914. He&#x2019;d gather a group of his animators, colorists, and storyboard artists to explain how they made Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck come to life. Each week, Disney created a made-�up world, used cutting-�edge technology to enable it, and then told us how he&#x2019;d done it.<br><br>Walt Disney was one of my two boyhood idols. The other was Albert Einstein. To me, even at a young age, they represented the two poles of creativity. Disney was all about inventing the new. He brought things into being&#x2014;�both artistically and technologically&#x2014;�that did not exist before. Einstein, by contrast, was a master of explaining that which already was. I read every Einstein biography I could get my hands on as well as a little book he wrote on his theory of relativity. I loved how the concepts he developed forced people to change their approach to physics and matter, to view the universe from a different perspective. Wild-�haired and iconic, Einstein dared to bend the implications of what we thought we knew. He solved the biggest puzzles of all and, in doing so, changed our understanding of reality.<br><br>Both Einstein and Disney inspired me, but Disney affected me more because of his weekly visits to my family&#x2019;s living room. &#x201c;When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are,&#x201d; his TV show&#x2019;s theme song would announce as a baritone-�voiced narrator promised: &#x201c;Each week, as you enter this timeless land, one of these many worlds will open to you . . . .&#x201d; Then the narrator would tick them off: Frontierland (&#x201c;tall tales and true from the legendary past&#x201d;), Tomorrowland (&#x201c;the promise of things to come&#x201d;), Adventureland (&#x201c;the wonder world of nature&#x2019;s own realm&#x201d;), and Fantasyland (&#x201c;the happiest kingdom of them all&#x201d;). I loved the idea that animation could take me places I&#x2019;d never been. But the land I most wanted to learn about was the one occupied by the innovators at Disney who made these animated films.<br><br>Between 1950 and 1955, Disney made three movies we consider classics today: Cinderella, Peter Pan, and Lady and the Tramp. More than half a century later, we all remember the glass slipper, the Island of Lost Boys, and that scene where the cocker spaniel and the mutt slurp spaghetti. But few grasp how technically sophisticated these movies were. Disney&#x2019;s animators were at the forefront of applied technology; instead of merely using existing methods, they were inventing ones of their own. They had to develop the tools to perfect sound and color, to use blue screen matting and multi-�plane cameras and xerography. Every time some technological breakthrough occurred, Walt Disney incorporated it and then talked about it on his show in a way that highlighted the relationship between technology and art. I was too young to realize such a synergy was groundbreaking. To me, it just made sense that they belonged together.<br><br>Watching Disney one Sunday evening in April of 1956, I experienced something that would define my professional life. What exactly it was is difficult to describe except to say that I felt something fall into place inside my head. That night&#x2019;s episode was called &#x201c;Where Do the Stories Come From?&#x201d; and Disney kicked it off by praising his animators&#x2019; knack for turning everyday occurrences into cartoons. That night, though, it wasn&#x2019;t Disney&#x2019;s explanation that pulled me in but what was happening on the screen as he spoke. An artist was drawing Donald Duck, giving him a jaunty costume and a bouquet of flowers and a box of candy with which to woo Daisy. Then, as the artist&#x2019;s pencil moved around the page, Donald came to life, putting up his dukes to square off with the pencil lead, then raising his chin to allow the artist to give him a bow tie.<br><br>The definition of superb animation is that each character on the screen makes you believe it is a thinking being. Whether it&#x2019;s a T-�Rex or a slinky dog or a desk lamp, if viewers sense not just movement but intention&#x2014;�or, put another way, emotion&#x2014;�then the animator has done his or her job. It&#x2019;s not just lines on paper anymore; it&#x2019;s a living, feeling entity. This is what I experienced that night, for the first time, as I watched Donald leap off the page. The transformation from a static line drawing to a fully dimensional, animated image was sleight of hand, nothing more, but the mystery of how it was done&#x2014;�not just the technical process but the way the art was imbued with such emotion&#x2014;�was the most interesting problem I&#x2019;d ever considered. I wanted to climb through the TV screen and be part of this world.<br><br>The mid-�1950s and early 1960s were, of course, a time of great prosperity and industry in the United States. Growing up in Utah in a tight-�knit Mormon community, my four younger brothers and sisters and I felt that anything was possible. Because the adults we knew had all lived through the Depression, World War II, and then the Korean War, this period felt to them like the calm after a thunderstorm.<br><br>I remember the optimistic energy&#x2014;�an eagerness to move forward that was enabled and supported by a wealth of emerging technologies. It was boom time in America, with manufacturing and home construction at an all-�time high. Banks were offering loans and credit, which meant more and more people could own a new TV, house, or Cadillac. There were amazing new appliances like disposals that ate your garbage and machines that washed your dishes, although I certainly did my share of cleaning them by hand. The first organ transplants were performed in 1954; the first polio vaccine came a year later; in 1956, the term artificial intelligence entered the lexicon. The future, it seemed, was already here.<br><br>Then, when I was twelve, the Soviets launched the first artificial satellite&#x2014;�Sputnik 1&#x2014;�into earth&#x2019;s orbit. This was huge news, not just in the scientific and political realms but in my sixth grade classroom at school, where the morning routine was interrupted by a visit from the principal, whose grim expression told us that our lives had changed forever. Since we&#x2019;d been taught that the Communists were the enemy and that nuclear war could be waged at the touch of a button, the fact that they&#x2019;d beaten us into space seemed pretty scary&#x2014;proof that they had the upper hand.<br><br>The United States government&#x2019;s response to being bested was to create something called ARPA, or the Advanced Research Projects Agency. Though it was housed within the Defense Department, its mission was ostensibly peaceful: to support scientific researchers in America&#x2019;s universities in the hopes of preventing what it termed &#x201c;technological surprise.&#x201d; By sponsoring our best minds, the architects of ARPA believed, we&#x2019;d come up with better answers. Looking back, I still admire that enlightened reaction to a serious threat: We&#x2019;ll just have to get smarter. ARPA would have a profound effect on America, leading directly to the computer revolution and the Internet, among countless other innovations. There was a sense that big things were happening in America, with much more to come. Life was full of possibility.<br><br>Still, while my family was middle-�class, our outlook was shaped by my father&#x2019;s upbringing. Not that he talked about it much. Earl Catmull, the son of an Idaho dirt farmer, was one of fourteen kids, five of whom had died as infants. His mother, raised by Mormon pioneers who made a meager living panning for gold in the Snake River in Idaho, didn&#x2019;t attend school until she was 11. My father was the first in his family ever to go to college, paying his own way by working several jobs. During my childhood, he taught math during the school year and built houses during the summers. He built our house from the ground up. While he never explicitly said that education was paramount, my siblings and I all knew we were expected to study hard and go to college.</p><h2>Fanny Mendelssohn (Amadeus)</h2><p>This is the first English-language biography of Fanny Mendelssohn, the older sister of Felix Mendelssohn and a gifted composer and pianist in her own right. Under pressure to neglect her talents in favor of her brother, Fanny stifled her career, and most of her 400 compositions have only recently become known. HARDCOVER</p><p>Fanny Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (1805-1847), like her younger brother Felix, demonstrated prodigious musical talent as a child. In their youth, Fanny and Felix were inseparable friends; they encouraged each other, collaborated in musical endeavors, and received the same education and training from distinguished tutors. But as an adolescent, Fanny was told by her father that her role as a woman was to concern herself with her home and that music could be only secondary, even though she had become a remarkable pianist and composer. She married Wilhelm Hensel, a respected portrait painter who encouraged her musical talents. Fulfilling her domestic role as wife and as mother of their son, Sebastian, she continued to compose - principally lieder - and to organize concerts in her home that became an integral part of the Berlin musical scene. Her talents were warmly received during a journey to Italy, particularly by Gounod, who heard her play from memory the music of Bach, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn. At forty years of age Fanny finally went against the orders of her father and of Felix and published her compositions. She had just begun to receive critical praise when she died suddenly at the age of forty-two. Her death was a devastating blow to Felix, who survived her by barely six months. This book, originally published in French in 1992, is the first and only authoritative biography of Fanny Mendelssohn and contains a complete list of her published compositions. Set against the backdrop of a privileged life in Berlin in the early nineteenth century, Francoise Tillard&#39;s vivid portrait describes an exceptional artist - she left behind four hundred works - who could have held her own among thegreatest if she had not been prohibited from venturing into the professional world.Fran�oise Tillard is a pianist and founder of the Trio Brentano. Her CD, issued by Harmonia Mundi, is entitled _Fanny Mendelssohn: Lieder and Trios._ She resides in Paris.</p><h2>Star Trek: The Original Series: Crucible: McCoy: Provenance of Shadows</h2><p>David R.

And so with the crowd buzzing and the big game up to her, Alta steps up to the pitcher's mound, determined to prove everybody wrong.</p><p>Inspired by the life of pioneering female baseball player Alta Weiss, and dramatized by Terry Widener's bold illustrations, <i>Girl Wonder</i> tells the unforgettable story of a true American original.</p></p><p><b>Deborah Hopkinson</b> is the author of numerous award-winning children's books, including <i>Sweet Clara and the Freedom Quilt,</i> winner of the International Reading Association Award, <i>Girl Wonder,</i> winner of the Great Lakes Book Award, and <i>Apples to Oregon,</i> a Junior Library Guild Selection.

"Nothing could keep me from baseball . . . By the time I was seventeen I'd struck out every boy in town." In prose that reflects the easy rhythms of balls and strikes, Hopkinson tells the story of teenager Alta Weiss, who in 1907 pitched for a semipro all-male team in Ohio. Alta's first-person narrative begins with her own memory of playing catch, and her family's image of her throwing a corn cob at a barn cat at the age of two. Alta practices, plays, and wins over the crowd in her first game. That summer she's the draw of her team, the Independents; people come to see "Girl Wonder" play. She plays a second season, but then she goes on to medical school (the only female in the class of 1914). Hopkinson enriches her burnished prose with an author's note about the real Alta Weiss and a chronology of women in baseball. Widener's exaggerated faces and rubbery-looking bodies are set in a picture plane of bright acrylics, where a bat or glove might pop out over the edge: a logo of ball and bats marks the innings of Alta's life. There's a sturdy charm to Alta's voice, and an unmistakable passion for the game. The black-and-white photograph on the back of the dust jacket brings added dimension to the story of a young woman who follows her dreams. <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The fighting often wakes them from a sound sleep, causing Claire and Joe to cry. The crying makes their father angrier--sometimes he even hits their mother.</p><p>Sharon Chesler Bernstein is an Albert Whitman author.Grade 1-3-- A bibliotherapeutic tool about domestic violence that's best placed on parenting shelves. An introductory paragraph stresses the universality of family disagreements, then distinguishes between them and family violence. As Henry attempts to shield his younger siblings from their father's abuse of their mother, he worries, experiences embarrassment and fear, and succumbs to daydreaming. Final comments stress that the children are not the cause of or to be blamed for their parents' actions. Appended are lists of what children can do to help themselves and what parents can do. In soft and muted tones, Ritz's sepia and charcoal scenes enhance and elucidate the text. These double-page spreads feature frightened, bewildered, or helpless children; an innovative decorative technique gives the paper the look of having been ripped forcibly from a tablet. Paris's Mommy and Daddy Are Fighting (Seal Pr., 1986) is aimed at a somewhat younger audience, yet places more emphasis on discussion techniques with specific questions offered on feelings, family violence, and family issues. A book on a much needed topic, related in a competent and assuring manner. --Celia A.

Using a variety of feminine and masculine pseudonyms to theorize about the concept of fashion and to report and advise on womens clothing, popular vacation destinations, home furnishings and entertainment, Mallarme created a spectacularly original work that lies somewhere between Baudelaires seminal treatment of fashion in his essay on modernity, The Painter of Modern Life, and The Fashion System, Barthes brilliant semiology of clothing in the latter twentieth century. But the distinguishing feature of Mallarms magazine, and what differentiates it from the writing of Baudelaire and Barthes, is that it explores the nature of fashion from the inside. It is a genuine fashion magazine aspiring to lead fashion, though at the same time, by ingenious and appealing ironies, subtly satirizing this whole genre of writing. Various theories have been entertained about the work in the past, such as its being a prose poem, or alternatively a hoax or a mere money-making venture, but the present translators, in their commentary, argue that such guesses are hopelessly off the mark.Complete with the original artwork and a contextualizing introduction and commentary, Furbank and Cains definitive translation of one of French literatures greatest puzzles and surprises represents a major contribution to students, critics, theoreticians, and intellectual historians alike.</p><p><p>P.

And after Jeff was diagnosed with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2000, Freedom returned his gift. Between sessions of debilitating chemotherapy, Jeff went back to Sarvey and began taking Freedom for walks that soothed his spirit and gave him the strength to fight. When he learned he was cancer free, Jeff's first stop was Sarvey to walk with Freedom. Somehow this special bird seemed to understand the significance of the day. For the very first time she wrapped both her wings around Jeff, enveloping him in an avian hug. </p><p>In March 2008, Jeff shared his extraordinary experience with his friend Gayle in an e-mail of eight hundred words:</p><blockquote><p>When Freedom came in she could not stand.

The myths and folklore of northern Europe are full of stories that involve the powerful spiritual presence provided by trees. Trees are full of the energy and life force provided by Mother Earth. At one time, tree worship was extremely common. People who lived in forested areas observed the mysterious growth of trees, and believed it to be caused by the spirits who lived inside them. Trees were thought to be the homes of the gods, and the rustling of the leaves spoke an otherworldly message. Trees were rooted in the earth but reached up into heaven. The mystery of trees that shed their leaves in autumn, and produced beautiful new leaves in spring, symbolized rebirth and renewal. Evergreen trees symbolized the universal, everlasting spirit. The superstition of knocking on wood for luck dates all the way back to ancient tree worship.</p> <p>Trees provided shelter and shade, and timber provided heat and building materials. Amulets and talismans were made from their wood, and they were planted in strategic positions to provide pro�tection from the forces of evil. The fruits, flowers, leaves, and roots provided food and medicine. People gained energy and emotional healing by walking through a forest or grove of trees.</p> <p>The ancient Canaanites deified the tree. Tree trunks were shorn of their branches and erected for worship. These trunks were sacred to the goddess Asherah and shared her name. Chips or splin�ters taken from an asherah were prized and sought after, as they bestowed fertility and abundance. The saying &#x201c;a chip off the old block&#x201d; comes from this belief.</p> <p>There is even an apparent reference to the magical and spiri�tual aspects of trees in the Bible. Genesis 21:33 reads: &#x201c;And Abra�ham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.&#x201d;</p> <p>The ancient Celts venerated the oak, ash, and thorn, believ�ing the trio to be an extremely powerful and sacred combination. Groves containing all three of these are particularly magical places. Many people have claimed to see fairies while resting or meditat�ing in a grove containing the triad of ash, oak, and thorn.</p> <p>The English tell a charming legend about Joseph of Arimathea. When he arrived at Glastonbury in 63 ce, he planted his staff in the ground on Wearyall Hill and it immediately blossomed into a hawthorn tree. This tree, known as the Holy Thorn, bloomed every Christmas. A Puritan cut it down in 1643, but fortunately its descendants survived and bloom to this day. A new Holy Thorn was planted on the hill in 1951.</p> <p>The maypole dance, still performed in many English villages on the first day of May each year, is derived from ancient fertility rituals. Traditionally, people gathered flowers and greenery to help celebrate this day and to bring fertility to the entire community. Originally, people danced around a hawthorn tree, but over time this was superseded by a pole garlanded with flowers.</p> <p>The burning of the yule log at Christmas was originally per�formed to encourage the sun to return and create spring. The yule log is almost always as the Holy Thorn, bloomed every Christmas. A Puritan cut it down in 1643, but fortunately its descendants survived and bloom to this day. A new Holy Thorn was planted on the hill in 1951.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The maypole dance, still performed in many English villages on the first day of May each year, is derived from ancient fertility rituals. Traditionally, people gathered flowers and greenery to help celebrate this day and to bring fertility to the entire community. Originally, people danced around a hawthorn tree, but over time this was superseded by a pole garlanded with flowers.</p> <p>The burning of the yule log at Christmas was originally per�formed to encourage the sun to return and create spring. The yule log is almost always oak.</p> <p>The Tree of Life appears in many creation mythologies, includ�ing those of the Zoroastrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians. The belief is that the world is flat and a large tree supports the heavens above. </p> <p>The Yakut of Siberia tell the story of the first man who set out to explore the world. He came across a huge tree that joined heaven, Earth, and the Underworld. The spirit of the tree used its leaves to communicate with the gods. The first man was lonely and asked the tree for help. The spirit of the tree caused a young woman to emerge from beneath its roots. She offered him milk from her breasts, and immediately the man was filled with confi�dence, strength, and energy._</p> <p>The Tree of Life mentioned in the Bible (Genesis 2:9 and 3:22) conferred immortality. People sometimes confuse this tree with the one from which Adam and Eve ate. That tree is called the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Of course, once Adam and Eve had been expelled from the Garden of Eden they left the Tree of Life behind, which meant they were no longer immortal.</p> <p>Stories of this sort show just how magical trees were to ancient people.</p> <p>Pre-Columbian cultures saw the world in much the same way. A silk cotton or kapok tree, known as the World Tree, rose from the Underworld and ascended to the heavens. The Mayans believed the souls of the dead climbed this tree to get to heaven. The souls of people who committed suicide rested in the shade of the World Tree, and were protected by the goddess Ixtab.</p> <p>The ancient Chinese also worshipped trees. Chinese mythol�ogy includes a number of huge trees that connect heaven and Earth. People are able to climb them to get to heaven, but to proceed further they need to gain the approval of the guardian deities who sit at the top of the tree. The leaning mulberry tree was one of the most important of these. In Chinese mythology, ten suns rose from the mulberry tree and caused a drought that threatened the entire world. Fortunately, a famous archer named Yu killed nine of the suns with his arrows, and thus saved the entire world from disaster.</p> <p>Another important tree in Chinese lore is the peach, known as the Tree of Life. It was one of seven trees that grew on the slopes of the Kuen-Lu�n Mountains. The goddess Si Wang Mu gave gifts of peaches to people, and anyone who received one became immortal. The peach blossoms in February, considered a good time of the year for weddings. Even today the Chinese consider the peach to be a symbol of longevity, immortality, and a happy marriage. Chi�nese artists frequently show the God of Long Life emerging from a ripe peach.</p> <p>Trees were frequently decorated with garlands and lanterns as part of tree worship. Shrines were often placed in the fork of a tree, as this is where local gods lived. A strip of red cloth was sometimes attached to the tree to protect it and ward off evil spirits.</p> <p>In Scandinavia, Yggdrasil was a huge ash tree at the center of the world. Its roots went all the way down to the Underworld, its trunk was in the world of humans, and its branches were up in the heavens. A famous story tells how Odin hung himself upside down on this tree for nine nights in order to gain wisdom, understanding, and knowledge of the runes.</p> <p>In Bali, the banyan tree is believed to connect heaven and Earth.</p> <p>The Tree of Life is also the name given to the diagram of the Kabbalah, which was originally depicted as a tree.</p> <p>The Dyak tribes in Borneo have a Tree of Life called <em>Kayu Abilau</em>, which can be climbed by dream-wanderers when they are in a trance state. Once they have climbed the tree, they can talk to Aping, their god of the forest.</p> <p>Various mythologies tell how mankind was created from trees. In Norse mythology, Odin and his brothers created the first man, Askr, from an ash tree, and his wife, Embla, from an elm. In the Greek tradition, Zeus used the trunks of ash trees to create the bronze men.</p> <p>A tribe of Australian aborigines called the Yarralin has a grove of trees near Lingara, in the Northern Territory, which is used for sacred dreaming. Young men gather clay from the billabong, or water hole, in the middle of the grove and mix it with scrapings of bark from the trees to make a potion they believe will help them attract women. Their womenfolk also have dreaming trees, and visit them to receive the necessary spiritual essence to stimulate conception and birth.</p> <p>Many trees have been considered sacred and magical at differ�ent times. Here are some of the most important of them:</p> <p>Alder</p> <p>The alder tree burns easily and has been called the tree of fire. In the Greek tradition, the alder was sacred to Phoroneus, the inven�tor of fire. In Celtic mythology, the alder is extremely brave and fought in the front line during the battle of the trees. Whistles made from alder wood are reputed to be able to harness and con�trol the four winds. Flutes can also be made from alder and used for magical purposes. Herbalists in Europe prescribed alder bark to treat inflammations. Heated alder leaves were used to treat chronic skin problems, and the bark and leaves were used to create a gargle to relieve mouth ulcers.</p> <p>Almond</p> <p>The almond tree has been considered the tree of wisdom ever since Jeremiah saw an almond branch in a vision (Jeremiah 1:11). This branch symbolized the gift of prophecy and wisdom that God gave to Jeremiah.</p> <p>Moses took twelve rods from different families into the tab�ernacle, and Aaron&#x2019;s rod was made of almond wood. While in the tabernacle it budded, blossomed, and produced almonds (Numbers 17:8). This signified that Aaron and his descendants would become the religious leaders of the Jewish people.</p> <p>The ancient Aramaic name for almond is <em>luz</em>, which means &#x201c;light.&#x201d; This is because they believed divine light shone mystically from the almond. Jacob experienced his famous dream while stay�ing at Luz, an almond grove in Canaan (Genesis 28:11&#x2013;19). This divine light is still represented in the menorah today, which con�tains a light for all seven planets.</p> <p>In the Christian tradition, the almond symbolizes divine grace and is associated with the Virgin Mary. In Persia, the almond sym�bolized the tree of heaven. In China, the almond symbolizes femi�ninity and the necessary strength to surmount difficult situations.</p> <p>The almond tree is popular with fairies who enjoy its sweet�ness and modest nature.</p> <p>Apple</p> <p>The apple tree was sacred to the Druids. Apple was considered a tree of choice, since meditating under it would help one make the correct decision. Magic wands are frequently made from apple wood. The Druids associated it with fertility and marriage.</p> <p>The apple has been associated with health, passion, and earthly pleasures since the time of the ancient Greeks. The Greeks dedi�cated the apple to Demeter, goddess of sustenance, and Aphrodite, goddess of love.</p> <p>Many people assume the forbidden fruit that Eve gave to Adam was an apple. However, the Bible refers to it only as fruit from the &#x201c;tree of the knowledge of good and evil&#x201d; (Genesis 2:17).</p> <p>If you cut an apple in half horizontally to the stem, the core forms a pentagram, a sacred figure in magic. The fruit of the apple is frequently used in spells and potions to attract love. In fairy tales, the eating of an apple virtually guaranteed a young couple would be blessed with children. During the Renaissance, young French�men tried to capture the hearts of young maidens by offering them an apple. In medieval Germany, young men carved letters into an apple before giving it to their girlfriends to eat. An old Italian story tells how a pig accidentally ate one of these apples and fell madly in love with the young man who had carved letters into it.</p> <p>Not long ago I saw a young woman twisting the stem of an apple while calling out the letters of the alphabet. She was follow�ing an ancient ritual that says the stem will break when she calls out the first letter of the name of her future lover.</p> <p>A close friend of mine, who regularly communicates with trees, insists the apple tree is the happiest, friendliest tree of all. It enjoys providing a bountiful crop of fruit for people who look after it.</p> <p>An old English custom says that people can help apple trees produce bountiful crops over many years by drinking cider under them and offering them a toast.</p> <p>Pruned branches from an apple tree can be burned in a fire�place to bring good luck to everyone living in the home. For best results, soak the branches in brine or seawater for a lunar month (twenty-eight days). Allow the branches to dry out completely and then enjoy the pleasant odor they produce while burning.</p> <p>The story of John Chapman (1774&#x2013;1845), better known as Johnny Appleseed, has become an integral part of American cul�ture. His mission in life was to grow and distribute apple trees. He collected seeds from cider presses in Pennsylvania and carried them west on horseback. He sold his trees for a &#x201c;flip penny bit&#x201d; (about six cents) but also accepted used clothing and promissory notes as payment. He also gave away trees to farmers who could not afford to buy them. His generosity, eccentric appearance, and cheerful personality all contributed to the legend that grew up about him. The words on his tombstone read: &#x201c;He lived for others.&#x201d;</p> <p>Ash</p> <p>The ash has been considered a sacred tree for thousands of years. An ancient Norse tradition claims that the first man was created from the branches of an ash tree. (The same tradition says the first woman was created from an elm.) The ash is sometimes referred to as the tree of knowledge. The Celts considered it a tree of enchant�ment, and Druids made healing wands from its branches. The ancient Greeks carried pieces of ash with them as lucky charms when traveling over water. This was because ash was considered sacred to Poseidon, the god of the ocean.</p> <p>An ash leaf containing an even number of leaflets is consid�ered extremely fortunate and is still sometimes used as a charm to attract love. If you place the leaf under your pillow, you will dream of your future lover. Unfortunately, ash leaves with an even number of leaflets are extremely rare. Young women had to recite a rhyme when they found one: </p> <p>This even ash I double in three,</p> <p>The first man I meet my true love shall be;</p> <p>If he be married let him pass by,</p> <p>But if he be single, let him draw nigh.</p> <p>Banyan</p> <p>The banyan tree (<em>Ficus bengalensis</em>) has always been one of the most sacred trees in Asia. It is connected to Brahma, the immortal spirit or essence of the universe. Consequently, in India the banyan tree symbolizes immortality. The banyan tree is also considered remark�able, since it keeps on growing no matter how many of its branches are cut. The banyan is also related to people who grow and develop spiritually. Nowadays, people still water the roots and place offer�ings on banyan trees to attract good luck, happiness, and fertility.</p> <p>See also <em>Bodhi</em>.</p> <p>Beech</p> <p>Until the Iron Age, the beech was a valuable source of food for people&#x2015;who ate its leaf buds, leaves, and nuts.

There are also sections on general herb cultivation and maintenance, and tips on cooking with them. The author runs her own herb farm and has won many awards, including a Silver Gilt Medal at the Royal Horticultural Society Exhibition in 1993.</p><p><p> <b>Jekka McVicar</b> has been growing organic herbs for 20 years.

Over 30 years ago I started work on a herb farm in Somerset, England; it was then that my thirst for more knowledge was ignited. During the subsequent years I started, with my husband, a herb farm in South Gloucestershire that was originally wholesale and has now developed into a mail order business with the advent of the Internet. In 1992 we started exhibiting at the Royal Horticultural Society flower shows, where we have been awarded over 60 Gold medals for our herb exhibits. </p><p> I wrote the original <i>Complete Herb Book</i> because, after exhibiting at the RHS flower shows, I found that I was being overwhelmed with requests for practical information on the growing and the use of each herb. The book stemmed from first-hand knowledge obtained from running my organic herb farm as well as considerable research. </p><p> One of the questions I am often asked is "What is a herb?" It can be argued that all useful plants are herbs. <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i> defines them as "plants of which the leaves, stem or flowers are used for food or medicine, or in some way for their scent or flavor." That many herbs do you good is in no doubt, improving your health, appearance or sense of well-being. </p><p> This new edition of the <i>Complete Herb Book</i>, which includes 38 new herbs, also shows how far organic horticulture has developed during the past decade. What I find exciting is that the development and knowledge of these plants is ever increasing and as I travel throughout the United Kingdom and overseas lecturing I realize that the interest in herbs as part of a movement toward a healthier, greener lifestyle is accelerating, so it is an appropriate time for this updated book. </p><p> For a newcomer to the world of herbs the most extraordinary feature of these plants is their incredible versatility. You may think of a particular herb as having mainly culinary or medicinal properties and then discover it has other useful applications. A herb that is greatly valued in cooking may also be of value for its medicinal properties. A plant such as thyme can provide the raw material for cooking, medicines and aromatherapy. I have included many culinary recipes in this book because herbs can transform a meal into a feast; there is nothing more inspiring than walking into a kitchen that is full of the aromas of herbs as their essential oils mingle with the food. </p><p> Herbs have been my life for over three decades. In this book I have tried to convey to you just some of the pleasure that working with these remarkable plants can bring. </p><p> Please note that the image in the colored box at the beginning of each herb is the first one described in the text. I'm sure I don't need to remind you, but please don't dig up any wild plants. </p><p> -- </p><p><b> HOW TO USE THIS BOOK </b></p><p> This book is comprised of two main sections: </p><p><b> The A-Z of Herbs </b></p><p> The A-Z of Herbs is arranged alphabetically by the botanical Latin name with detailed information for each specific herb such as <br> <i>Other Names:</i> lists some folk and country names.<br> <i>Natural Habitat:</i> native country and area of distribution. <br> <i>Propagation:</i> provides helpful tips for the individual herb that will make all the difference between success and failure.

Anything in the world. I would follow those hands out to the desert. I would. I would watch them </p> <p>on the black leather curve of the steering wheel. I would watch them light a cigarette with the glowing car lighter after it made a low pop and smelled vaguely of burnt food. And I would watch them as she gestured when she spoke, as if she were weighing air or beckoning someone near. At times I notice her watching her own hands, admiring their white elegant angles and delicately draped bones. When I notice her watching her own hands, I look away, my eyes shy from shame.</p> <p>"Mina," she says, and I like it when she says my name and leaves it there hanging, like a statement, or barks it, "Mina," like an order.</p> <p>"Leave everything," she says. "The one thing you can't leave behind is the thing you absolutely must."</p> <p>OK, OK, sure, but we take money. Lots and lots of it. Lorene's more than mine. And her car. But nothing else. Not a book or a change of clothes. Not a ring or a stocking or a journal or a fountain pen.</p> <p>We lunch at a truck stop. Laminated menus with heart-healthy options. Pale coffee and everything smells like syrup.</p> <p>"Look, sugar cubes," Lorene says, dropping one after the other into her coffee, letting each one balance on the spoon, then submerging it until it becomes saturated with the pale brown liquid.</p> <p>"It reminds me of a commercial," I say.</p> <p>"Yeah," Lorene says, "me too. Why do I keep doing this," she submerges the cube slowly and watches it absorb coffee, "why do I get such a kick out of this."</p> <p>"I don't remember which, maybe not sugar," I say. "Maybe the cube is used as a demonstration."</p> <p>"You mean an absorbency demonstration?" Lorene asks.</p> <p>"Yes, exactly something almost like that. Absorbency."</p> <p>"There were so many demonstration commercials. So visual, so scientific."</p> <p>"Sugar cubes. I really like sugar cubes. Why'd they go and get rid of sugar cubes?" I say, all of a sudden extremely sad about it.</p> <p>"Packets, perhaps, offer labels, small type, nutritional information, a higher ability to sanitize. Last longer. There's the anticipatory shaking gesture, loading the granules into one end of the envelope so it can be torn without spilling. Improved delivery system of loose granules versus cubes. Dissolves easier. Makes it easier to use more. Nefarious plot to destroy my body's ecosystem. Yeast- and microbe-feeding, inner-organ-caramelizing sugar," Lorene continues, stirring her coffee, pushing it back and taking another drag on her cigarette. "But it makes the coffee palatable, which in turn makes the cigarette enjoyable, which in fact makes the morning bearable."</p> <p>The waitress is adjusting her stockings. She thinks no one is looking, and she pulls at the fabric of her skirt, nearly jumps with the pull. She reaches to the back of her knee, gets a handful of nylon, inches it up, a minor hike, then tries again, through the skirt, the little jump-hike.</p> <p>"A perfect system. Airtight. No complaints," I say.</p> <p>Still, I know that isn't it. No good reason to get rid of cubes. An object of unremarked-upon delight rendered less than what it was. It's what Michael would say, it's the sort of pleasing detail you never seem to notice until one day it's gone.</p> <p>Lorene slips two fingers through the handle of her coffee cup and braces it against the fingertips of her other hand. She lifts the cup to her mouth, closes her eyes, and sips the hot, sugary liquid.</p> <p>But maybe, just maybe, that's not it either. Maybe sugar cubes seem pleasing just because they're gone, and that kind of detail brings you pleasure only as a contemplated lost thing, the pleasing nature of it is realized only because of its absence.</p> <p><b><i>One Month Before Leaving:</i></b></p> <p><b><i>The Cocktail Hour</i></b></p> <p>Mina watched him, examining his profile at twenty paces. Mina watched him, half-shadowed, through a window, half-lit with the amazing dusk light, even, or especially, L.A. movie-fake dusk light that could be thrown by a switch in a soundstage. A fading soft pink light that made her long for soundtrack swells, the softness making her think she longed for every person she ever thought she should have loved a little more, but really it was only a scented-hanky kind of nostalgia, an antiques shop nostalgia, or, finally, a cable channel documentary-type nostalgia for people and places you never even knew, not a longing for home, but a longing for "home." Mina had a weakness for this kind of bungalow dusk melodrama. When the whole city caught her off guard she found an emotional attachment to its past and she read its ugliness as its charm. It was then she felt she had finally got it, that it was her place, fleetingly, if only because of the light and its fading glow.</p> <p>He was part of that light, and she could not stop watching him in it. Through their window. From a distance. Not just that, but his unawareness of her watching.</p> <p>For the past two hours she had done the unthinkable, the violate: she walked. First through the Vista Del Mar neighborhood of old tiny 1920s bungalows, sort of Spanish Colonial with odd Moorish and Eastern flourishes, stuccoed and surrounded by palm trees, so arranged and moderne they seemed carved in Bakelite. Car-free, in summer ballet flats, the only one besides gardeners and children, Mina walked along curbs and looked through interior-lit windows, the fading dusk light affording anonymity, the TVs and stereos and nearly audible conversations providing a schizoid soundtrack -- strange juxtapositions of familiar radio sounds with other people's lives at an audio glance. Sometimes just a name, spoken and unanswered, hung in the air, or whole arguments at high volume. She could pause and listen for hours to fragments of conversations about dinner or car keys or mail.</p> <p>She had walked the long way from Max's apartment in the Hills, then headed down Gower past Sunset and Santa Monica. The streets had already thickened with homebound cars, five o'clock sliding into six o'clock, a special segue time that was once called, by someone, somewhere, the cocktail hour. People used to slip seamlessly from Hollywood General on Highland, from all the rattan and wickered bungalows on the Paramount lot over on Gower, to, where? Maybe the Cinegrill at the Roosevelt Hotel. To a padded banquette at the Dresden, around crescent-shaped tables seemingly designed for fourth-wall-theater staging, or an <i>In a Lonely Place</i> lonely stool at the bar at the Brown Derby, or Musso and Frank's. Or a dozen other bars, long gone, that used to line Gower and Hollywood. Gower's Gulch. Actors, extras -- cowboys and gladiators. And all those suit-spectacled execs, in her mind all as young and three-buttoned and black-and-white as the photo of Irving Thalberg her father used to have in his study. It had that name, Gower's Gulch, back when it had a history, used to be called Gower's Gulch when cowboy-actor extras hung out, waiting in between calls at Paramount and Hollywood General. Mina's father told her (and where did he learn it, because it was well before his time, this ancient Hollywood history he seemed to know a priori and with detailed authority) they'd still be in costume, bursting into bars as if they were Wild West saloons, Max Factor'd pink plastic cowboys getting drunk, starting fights, feeling the difference between real bottles and breakaway glass. Mina walked past the corner minimall with its Western-style burnt-wood hanging sign. <i>Gower's Gulch Convenience Center.</i> Nice touch, and she wished, particularly when she passed the huge wrought-iron and adobe gates of the studio, that one teensy cowboy-actor bar had been salvaged, a secret perfect dive where she could have a drink that would afford her sanctuary, someplace simple and unself-conscious, a modest, sad dilapidated spot, an "establishment" offering mere refreshment and a minute of quiet solitary enjoyment -- a real drink, away from the ubiquitous new and bright and sandblasted. A bar, her father would have said, where there is no shame in ordering a scotch. Where a person could smoke a cigarette unmolested. But there were none, and Mina instead wandered into the old Paramount studio store, where in a montage of lightning edits -- color, hand, pocket, money, color, exit -- she quickly bought an armful of expensive cosmetics. A teal eye powder. A tiny brush to apply it. A waxy-smelling lipstick in a blue red (Caput Mortuum) made for black-and-white photography. Translucent face powder, loose, of course, and the fluffy real-horsehair brush to apply it. A bottle of Red nail polish. A concealer stick, in Bisque #9, Medium Fair. She left quickly, buzzing with the secrets of the universe in her paper bag, followed by, within seconds, dire regret. She opened the bag, there on the sidewalk, out in the sunlight, and stared at the Red nail polish, all wrong, really, the polish -- actually a Midwestern near-red, sort of weathered-barn colored -- not what she wanted at all. She stood there, dismayed by her failure to even address the shelf of red nail polishes -- the Original Real Red polish, so close to Raven Red and Scarlet Red but darker, oddly, than Carmine Crimson Red -- how she avoided the issue altogether, just grabbing Red, not even Simple Red, and of course the polish would never be exchanged, but tossed in a drawer with thirty other nearly perfect unused colors, until it became old and its chemical components started to separate, all the colors finally turning into an umber-orangey rusty red topped with a pool of murky colorless oil. She would just have to wait until she could devote the time, until she felt up to determining which, finally, would be Rita Hayworth Red. She barely resisted the urge to toss the whole bag of cosmetic purchases and go back in, to do it right, microexamine the red polishes, head back in there and trial-and-error the whole row. Spend hours on it. But instead she ambled in a zigzag on the pavement, staggering vaguely away from the place, her head looking back while her body went forward, ne...</p></p><h2>Trapeze: Poems</h2><p>These lush, rewarding reflections on a woman&#x2019;s passage into midlife are grounded in our intimacy with nature and mortality.

Like Elizabeth Bishop, an enabling model, Digges has been a keenly observant poet, a walker in the country, one of nature's intimates. So, too, as in Bishop, there is an underlying sense of peril -- of mortal panic -- driving her work, which is painfully sharpened by loss. "Call it a nearness like the room you make inside yourself for sorrow," she confesses in "Trillium." "Few are invited in." The 25 poems in Trapeze are written in what she calls "the aftermath of youth" and filled with stray moments of beauty held aloft and rescued from oblivion.</p><p>Digges has developed a rich, sensuous and rhythmical free verse, a headlong vernacular style that at times reminds me of Galway Kinnell. The title of her previous collection, Rough Music, is apt. Her attack on a subject is often refracted, even oblique -- she has an odd associative wildness -- and yet her gaze is unwavering. I find something both tender and ruthless -- a furious cherishing -- in the way she looks hard at things. "The light/ of earth says simply gone, yes," she declares in the strange and wonderful poem "Gown of Moleskins." "As for your dead, they will be not be/ returning. The leafless burial woods fill/ with brilliant brutal light. How few/ you've loved toward posterity."</p><p> I greatly admire the emotional courage in Digges's book of thresholds and crossings, of farewells and hard departures. She will not shy away from what she stumbles upon in her explorations, as when she comes across two young mothers watching their toddlers on a beach in late March. "Once they looked back to show me myself at fifty,/ frightening to them, not yet recognizable, the self-/ same, almost, in an old nightmare obsolete," she observes at the end of "Boat."

Stephen King (Dark Tower Novel)</h2><p>Wind Through the Keyhole</p><p>&#39;At the age of 19 Stephen decided he would like to write an epic similar to The Lord of the Rings. The &#39;spaghetti Westerns&#39; of that time [specifically The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] and a poem written by Robert Browning, &#39;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came&#39;, became the inspiration for his magnum opus. The series written and published separately over a period of 22 years consists of seven books and the short story, &#39;The Little Sisters of Eluria&#39; published in his collection, EVERYTHING&#39;S EVENTUAL.&#39; From the author&#39;s website.An excerpt from <i>The Wind through the Keyhole: A Dark Tower Novel </i>by Stephen King<p>&nbsp;</p><p>FOREWORD</p><p>Most of the people holding this book have followed the adventures of Roland and his band&#x2014;his ka-tet&#x2014;for years, some of them from the very beginning. Others&#x2014;and I hope there are many, newcomers and Constant Readers alike&#x2014;may ask, <i>Can I read and enjoy this</i> <i>story if I haven&#x2019;t read the other Dark Tower books? </i>My answer is yes, if you keep a few things in mind. </p><p>First, Mid-World lies next to our world, and there are many overlaps. In some places there are doorways between the two worlds, and sometimes there are thin places, porous places, where the two worlds actually mingle. Three of Roland&#x2019;s ka-tet&#x2014;Eddie, Susannah, and Jake have been drawn separately from troubled lives in New York into Roland&#x2019;s Mid-World quest. Their fourth traveling companion, a billy-bumbler named Oy, is a golden-eyed creature native to Mid-World. Mid-World is very old, and falling to ruin, filled with monsters and untrustworthy magic. </p><p>Second, Roland Deschain of Gilead is a gunslinger&#x2014;one of a small band that tries to keep order in an increasingly lawless world. If you think of the gunslingers of Gilead as a strange combination of knights errant and territorial marshals in the Old West, you&#x2019;ll be close to the mark. Most of them, although not all, are descended from the line of the old White King, known as Arthur Eld (I told you there were overlaps).</p><p>Third, Roland has lived his life under a terrible curse. He killed his mother, who was having an affair&#x2014;mostly against her will, and certainly against her better judgment&#x2014;with a fellow you will meet in these pages. Although it was by mistake, he holds himself accountable, and the unhappy Gabrielle Deschain&#x2019;s death has haunted him since his young manhood. These events are fully narrated in the Dark Tower cycle, but for our purposes here, I think it&#x2019;s all you have to know. </p><p>For longtime readers, this book should be shelved between <i>Wizard</i> <i>and Glass </i>and <i>Wolves of the Calla </i>. . . which makes it, I suppose, <i>Dark Tower 4.5.</i></p><p>As for me, I was delighted to discover my old friends had a little more to say. It was a great gift to find them again, years after I thought their stories were told.</p><p>&#x2014;Stephen King</p><p>September 14, 2011</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>STARKBLAST</p><p>During the days after they left the Green Palace that wasn&#x2019;t Oz after all&#x2014;but which was now the tomb of the unpleasant fellow Roland&#x2019;s ka-tet had known as the Tick-Tock Man&#x2014;the boy Jake began to range farther and farther ahead of Roland, Eddie, and Susannah.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you worry about him?&#x201d; Susannah asked Roland. &#x201c;Out there on his own?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got Oy with him,&#x201d; Eddie said, referring to the billy-bumbler who had adopted Jake as his special friend. &#x201c;Mr. Oy gets along with nice folks all right, but he&#x2019;s got a mouthful of sharp teeth for those who aren&#x2019;t so nice. As that guy Gasher found out to his sorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jake also has his father&#x2019;s gun,&#x201d; Roland said. &#x201c;And he knows how to use it. That he knows very well. And he won&#x2019;t leave the Path of the Beam.&#x201d; He pointed overhead with his reduced hand. The lowhanging sky was mostly still, but a single corridor of clouds moved</p><p>steadily southeast. Toward the land of Thunderclap, if the note left behind for them by the man who styled himself RF had told the truth.</p><p>Toward the Dark Tower.</p><p>&#x201c;But why&#x2014;&#x201d; Susannah began, and then her wheelchair hit a bump. She turned to Eddie. &#x201c;Watch where you&#x2019;re pushin me, sugar.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Eddie said. &#x201c;Public Works hasn&#x2019;t been doing any maintenance along this stretch of the turnpike lately. Must be dealing with budget cuts.&#x201d;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t a turnpike, but it <i>was </i>a road . . . or had been: two ghostly ruts with an occasional tumbledown shack to mark the way. Earlier that morning they had even passed an abandoned store with a barely readable sign: TOOK&#x2019;S OUTLAND MERCANTILE. They investigated inside for supplies&#x2014;Jake and Oy had still been with them then&#x2014;and had found nothing but dust, ancient cobwebs, and the skeleton of what had been either a large raccoon, a small dog, or a billy-bumbler. Oy had taken a cursory sniff and then pissed on the bones before leaving the store to sit on the hump in the middle of the old road with his squiggle of a tail curled around him. He faced back the way they had come, sniffing the air. </p><p>Roland had seen the bumbler do this several times lately, and although he had said nothing, he pondered it. Someone trailing them, maybe? He didn&#x2019;t actually believe this, but the bumbler&#x2019;s posture&#x2014;nose lifted, ears pricked, tail curled&#x2014;called up some old memory or association that he couldn&#x2019;t quite catch.</p><p>&#x201c;Why does Jake want to be on his own?&#x201d; Susannah asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you find it worrisome, Susannah of New York?&#x201d; Roland asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Roland of Gilead, I find it <i>worrisome.</i>&#x201d; She smiled amiably enough, but in her eyes, the old mean light sparkled. That was the Detta Walker part of her, Roland reckoned. It would never be completely gone, and he wasn&#x2019;t sorry. Without the strange woman she had once been still buried in her heart like a chip of ice, she would have been only a handsome black woman with no legs below the knees. With Detta onboard, she was a person to be reckoned with. A dangerous one. A gunslinger.</p><p>&#x201c;He has plenty of stuff to think about,&#x201d; Eddie said quietly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been through a lot. Not every kid comes back from the dead. And it&#x2019;s like Roland says&#x2014;if someone tries to face him down, it&#x2019;s the someone who&#x2019;s apt to be sorry.&#x201d; Eddie stopped pushing the wheelchair, armed sweat from his brow, and looked at Roland. &#x201c;<i>Are </i>there someones in this particular suburb of nowhere, Roland? Or have they all moved on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, there are a few, I wot.&#x201d;</p><p>He did more than wot; they had been peeked at several times as they continued their course along the Path of the Beam. Once by a frightened woman with her arms around two children and a babe hanging in a sling from her neck. Once by an old farmer, a half-mutie with a jerking tentacle that hung from one corner of his mouth. Eddie and Susannah had seen none of these people, or sensed the others that Roland felt sure had, from the safety of the woods and high grasses, marked their progress. Eddie and Susannah had a lot to learn. </p><p>But they had learned at least some of what they would need, it seemed, because Eddie now asked, &#x201c;Are they the ones Oy keeps scenting up behind us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Roland thought of adding that he was sure something else was on Oy&#x2019;s strange little bumbler mind, and decided not to. The gunslinger had spent long years with no ka-tet, and keeping his own counsel had become a habit. One he would have to break, if the tet was to remain strong. But not now, not this morning.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s move on,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure we&#x2019;ll find Jake waiting for us up ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two hours later, just shy of noon, they breasted a rise and halted, looking down at a wide, slow-moving river, gray as pewter beneath the overcast sky. On the northwestern bank&#x2014;their side&#x2014;was a barnlike building painted a green so bright it seemed to yell into the muted day. Its mouth jutted out over the water on pilings painted a similar green. Docked to two of these pilings by thick hawsers was a large raft, easily ninety feet by ninety, painted in alternating stripes of red and yellow. A tall wooden pole that looked like a mast jutted from the center, but there was no sign of a sail. Several wicker chairs sat in front of it, facing the shore on their side of the river. Jake was seated in one of these. Next to him was an old man in a vast straw hat, baggy green pants, and longboots. On his top half he wore a thin white garment&#x2014;the kind of shirt Roland thought of as a slinkum. Jake and the old man appeared to be eating well-stuffed popkins. Roland&#x2019;s mouth sprang water at the sight of them.</p><p>Oy was beyond them, at the edge of the circus-painted raft, looking raptly down at his own reflection. Or perhaps at the reflection of the steel cable that ran overhead, spanning the river.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it the Whye?&#x201d; Susannah asked Roland.</p><p>&#x201c;Yar.&#x201d;</p><p>Eddie grinned. &#x201c;You say Whye; I say Whye Not?&#x201d; He raised one hand and waved it over his head. &#x201c;Jake! Hey, Jake! Oy!&#x201d; </p><p>Jake waved back, and although the river and the raft moored at its edge were still half a mile away, their eyes were uniformly sharp, and they saw the white of the boy&#x2019;s teeth as he grinned.</p><p>Susannah cupped her hands around her mouth. &#x201c;Oy! <i>Oy! </i>To me,</p><p>sugar! Come see your mama!&#x201d;</p><p>Uttering shrill yips that were the closest he could get to barks, Oy flew across the raft, disappeared into the barnlike structure, then emerged on their side. He came charging up the path with his ears lowered against his skull and his gold-ringed eyes bright.</p><p>&#x201c;Slow down, sug, you&#x2019;ll give yourself a heart attack!&#x201d; Susannah shouted, laughing.</p><p>Oy seemed to take this as an order to speed up. He arrived at Susannah&#x2019;s wheelchair in less than two minutes, jumped up into her lap, then jumped down again and looked at them cheerfully. &#x201c;Olan! Ed! Suze!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hile, Sir Throcken,&#x201d; Roland said, using the ancient word for bumbler he&#x2019;d first heard in a book read to him by his mother: <i>The</i> <i>Throcken and the Dragon.</i></p><p>Oy lifted his leg, watered a patch of grass, then faced back the way they had come, scenting at the air, eyes on the horizon. </p><p>&#x201c;Why does he keep doing that, Roland?&#x201d; Eddie asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; But he <i>almost </i>knew. Was it some old story, not The Throcken and the...</p></p><h2>Mixed: Portraits of Multiracial Kids</h2><p>From beloved writer and artist Kip Fulbeck, author of <em>Part Asian, 100% Hapa</em>, this timely collection of portraits celebrates the faces and voices of mixed-race children.

"They make beautiful landscape choices, are useful for cooking, controlling insect and disease pests, healing wounds, and are effective for improving the immune system." In this fully illustrated, easy-to-use guide, Garrett and veteran herbalist Odena Brannam offer expert advice on growing nearly 150 herbs suited to Texas and Southwestern gardens, along with detailed information on each plant's landscape, culinary, medicinal, and other uses.</p> <p>Individual entries give each herb's common and scientific names and instructions for planting, growing, harvesting, and storing it. The entries also include ideas for using each herb in gardening and cooking (with occasional recipes) and discuss its medicinal uses. A special "insight" section that offers intriguing, often little-known facts about the herb rounds out each entry, as well as a color photo.</p> <p>In addition to the individual herb descriptions, Garrett sets forth the basics of organic gardening, including pest control, and discusses how to design a herb garden and also raise roses, pecans, and fruit trees without chemicals. Of special interest are his instructions for making teas from dozens of herbs and his list of trees, shrubs, vines, and groundcovers with edible and/or medicinal properties. This wide range of information, not available for Texas herbs in any other single source, makes this book the perfect guide for homeowners, gardeners, landscapers, chefs, herbalists, and health care providers.</p></p><p>Dallas resident Howard Garrett is host of the radio gardening talk show &#34;The Natural Way&#34; (WBAP-820) and author of the Dallas Morning News column of the same name.</p><h2>If You Were a Penguin</h2><p>Amazing condition</p><p></p><h2>Polar the Titanic Bear</h2><p>A story of a boy, his teddy bear, and their escape the Titanic&#39;s sinking, originally told to the boy by his mother shortly after their family&#39;s escape from that tragedy, features beautiful illustrations and a fascinating glimpse into the past.</p><p>Imagine the excitement of rooting around in an old attic and discovering the letters, diaries, and photo albums of a relative. What if that memorabilia opened a window on the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>, the most famous sea disaster of all time? That's exactly what happened to Leighton H. Coleman III. Exploring the attic of his relative Daisy Corning Stone Spedden, he found many personal treasures, including a charming book Daisy had written for her 8-year-old son, Douglas, in 1913. This story, combined with award-winning artist Laurie McGaw's gorgeous watercolor illustrations, actual family photographs, keepsakes, and historic postcards, weaves the fabric of <i>Polar the Titanic Bear</i>, an engaging slice of history for all ages, told through the black glass eyes of an extraordinary toy bear named Polar.<p> The story begins in the toy workshop where Polar is born, and quickly moves to the point where he is given to "Master," Daisy Spedden's son Douglas. Soon the boy and bear are inseparable! As the wealthy Speddens are world travelers, Polar and his new family sail from New York to Algiers and on to the French Riviera, until it comes time for them to return to America on the <i>Titanic</i>. On the fateful night of the sinking, Polar and the Speddens are lucky enough to be lowered down the side of the luxury liner in a lifeboat, but when the family boards the rescue ship, Polar finds himself left behind! How will Polar make it back to his best friend? </p><p> In the epilogue, rich with family photographs, the historical context for the story is fully and engagingly explained, with more details on the <i>Titanic</i> disaster as well as a smattering of toy history. This is a wonderful gift book--the richness and emotion of the story are all the more poignant when enhanced by the Spedden family photographs, their tragic personal story, and the reflection of an era that will never exist again. (All ages ... excellent for reading aloud to ages 6 and older, but perfect for 9- to 12-year-olds, too.) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Daisy Corning Stone Spedden penned the manuscript for <i>Polar, The Titanic Bear</i> for her son, Douglas, after the family survived the Titanic disaster in 1912. The original booklet was found, among other items, by Leighton H. Coleman III, a distant relation of the Spedden family, in his grandfather's barn. After sending a copy of the story to the Titanic Historical Society, it came to the attention of Madison Press Books, who eventually published the story with Little, Brown and Company.<br>Laurie McGaw is well known for her portraits of renowned figures as well as her award-winning illustrations in <i>Polar The Titanic Bear </i>and <i>African Princess</i>.

Shockingly Close to the Truth! is the first and only comprehensive tell-all history of ufology from two men who have been at the center of this cultlike movement for close to half a century. James W. Moseley conveys the fun he has had over the years pursuing tall tales and purported evidence of visitors from outer space. As the creator of the newsletter Saucer Smear--the source on the follies, foibles, fads, and feuds of ufology--Moseley has the inside scoop on the amazing world of serious UFO sleuths and wigged-out &#34;saucer fiends.&#34; His co-author, Karl T. Pflock, has been tracking reports of unidentified flying objects for close to half a century and has written the most thorough investigation of the Roswell incident ever done.For Moseley it all began as a lark in 1953 when he drove across country and interviewed almost 100 UFO experts and eyewitnesses, including former president Harry S Truman. After all these years, his account of this journey is here published for the first time, a goldmine for anyone interested in modern social and &#34;ufological&#34; history. He also talks candidly about his encounters with and assessments of leading UFO personalities, including Budd Hopkins, George Adamski, J. Allen Hynek, and many others. In addition, he reveals the whole truth behind the infamous Straith letter hoax, the real origins of the Men in Black, and the true story of George Adamski&#39;s alleged 1952 encounter with &#34;a man from Venus.&#34; Along the way he recounts his incredible adventures as a grave robber of pre-Columbian artifacts in Peru (Move over Indiana Jones!), to which there is also a bizarre UFO connection. Complementing the exuberant narrative are many original photos of famous persons and events from Moseley&#39;s private collection, plus facsimile reproductions of the Straith letter and the complete October 1957 special Adamski expose issue of Smear&#39;s predecessor, Saucer News. A feast for UFO buffs this book will also interest students of popular culture, social trends, and the psychology of belief.</p><p>From Roswell to "The X-Files," UFO tales litter the landscape of modern popular culture. But what about the characters behind the scenes--and in front of the cameras--the people who make up the worldwide UFO subculture? <p>SHOCKINGLY CLOSE TO THE TRUTH! is the first-ever insider social history of ufology. Here, the amazing world of serious UFO sleuths and wigged-out "saucer fiends" is laid bare by two men who know where the bodies--alien and otherwise--are and are not buried. James W. Moseley has been at the center of "The Field" almost from the beginning. He tells all in the wry, lively, ironic style that has been the hallmark of his UFO commentaries and reporting since the early 1950s, when he stumbled into the world of flying saucers--a stranger in a very strange land. Moseley and his coauthor, Karl T. Pflock, an accomplished UFO hunter in his own right, take readers on an amusing, revealing, and entertaining romp through the confused and controversial history of UFOs and those who chase them. </p><p>For Moseley it all began in 1953, when he drove across the country and interviewed almost a hundred UFO experts and eyewitnesses, even speaking privately with former president Harry S. Truman about what he knew. At long last, the story of this amazing odyssey is published here for the first time, a gold mine for anyone interested in modern social and UFO history. Moseley also talks candidly about his encounters with and assessments of leading UFO personalities, including John Keel (THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES), Budd Hopkins, Philip Klass, Gray Barker, Donald Menzel, George Adamski, Donald Keyhoe, and J. Allen Hynek. In addition, he reveals the whole truth behind the infamous Straith letter hoax, the real origins of the Men in Black, and the inside scoop on Adamski's alleged 1952 encounter with "a Space Brother from Venus." Along the way he recounts his incredible adventures as a robber of pre-Columbian graves in Peru, to which there is also an amusing UFO connection. Complementing the exuberant narrative are fifty-one fascinating photos of famous and not-so-famous ufological persona and events, many never before published. </p><p>In SHOCKINGLY CLOSE TO THE TRUTH! Moseley and Pflock reveal the truth--or shockingly close to it--of a half century of ufology and "ufoology," from the innocent early days of 1950s Space Brother contactees to the paranoid present filled with government cover-ups and alien abductions--as lived, observed, interpreted, and to a considerable degree influenced by Jim Moseley himself.</p>James W.

In this magisterial biography, Patrick McGilligan brings young Orson into focus as never before. He chronicles Welles&#x2019;s early life growing up in Wisconsin and Illinois as the son of an alcoholic industrialist and a radical suffragist and classical musician, and the magical early years of his career, including his marriage and affairs, his influential friendships, and his artistic collaborations.</p><p>The tales of his youthful achievements were so colorful and improbable that Welles, with his air of mischief, was often thought to have made them up. Now after years of intensive research, McGilligan sorts out fact from fiction and reveals untold, fully documented anecdotes of Welles&#x2019;s first exploits and triumphs, from starring as a teenager on the Gate Theatre stage in Dublin and bullfighting in Sevilla, to his time in the New York theater and his fraught partnership with John Houseman in the Mercury Theatre, to his arrival in Hollywood and the making of <em>Citizen Kane</em>. Filled with intriguing new insights and startling revelations&#x2014;including the surprising true origin and meaning of &#x201c;Rosebud&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>Young Orson</em> is a fascinating look at the creative development and influences that shaped this legendary artistic genius.</p></p><p><p>&#x201c;A remarkable, eye-opening biography . . . McGilligan&#x2019;s Orson is a Welles for a new generation, [a portrait] in tune with Patti Smith&#x2019;s <em>Just Kids</em>.&#x201d;&#x2014;A. S. Hamrah, Bookforum</p><p>No American artist or entertainer has enjoyed a more dramatic rise than Orson Welles. At the age of sixteen, he charmed his way into a precocious acting debut in Dublin&#x2019;s Gate Theatre. By nineteen, he had published a book on Shakespeare and toured the United States. At twenty, he directed a landmark all-black production of <em>Macbeth</em> in Harlem, and the following year masterminded the legendary WPA production of Marc Blitzstein&#x2019;s agitprop musical <em>The Cradle Will Rock</em>. After founding the Mercury Theatre, he mounted a radio production of <em>The War of the Worlds</em> that made headlines internationally. Then, at twenty-four, Welles signed a Hollywood contract granting him unprecedented freedom as a writer, director, producer, and star&#x2014;paving the way for the creation of <em>Citizen Kane</em>, considered by many to be the greatest film in history.</p><p>Drawing on years of deep research, acclaimed biographer Patrick McGilligan conjures the young man&#x2019;s Wisconsin background with Dickensian richness and detail: his childhood as the second son of a troubled industrialist father and a musically gifted, politically active mother; his youthful immersion in theater, opera, and magic in nearby Chicago; his teenage sojourns through rural Ireland, Spain, and the Far East; and his emergence as a maverick theater artist. Sifting fact from legend, McGilligan unearths long-buried writings from Welles&#x2019;s school years; delves into his relationships with mentors Dr. Maurice Bernstein, Roger Hill, and Thornton Wilder; explores his partnerships with producer John Houseman and actor Joseph Cotten; reveals the truth of his marriage to actress Virginia Nicolson and rumored affairs with actresses Dolores Del Rio and Geraldine Fitzgerald (including a suspect paternity claim); and traces the story of his troubled brother, Dick Welles, whose mysterious decline ran counter to Orson&#x2019;s swift ascent. And, through it all, we watch in awe as this whirlwind of talent&#x2014;hailed hopefully from boyhood as a &#x201c;genius&#x201d;&#x2014;collects the raw material that he and his co-writer, the cantankerous Herman J. Mankiewicz, would mold into the story of Charles Foster Kane.</p><p>Filled with insight and revelation&#x2014;including the surprising true origin and meaning of &#x201c;Rosebud&#x201d;&#x2014;Young Orson is an eye-opening look at the arrival of a talent both monumental and misunderstood.</p><p>Patrick McGilligan is the author of <em>Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness</em> <em>and Light</em>; <em>Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast</em>; and <em>George Cukor: A Double Life</em>; and books on the lives of directors Nicholas Ray, Robert Altman, and Oscar Micheaux, and actors James Cagney, Jack Nicholson, and Clint Eastwood. He also edited the acclaimed five-volume <em>Backstory</em> series of interviews with Hollywood screenwriters and (with Paul Buhle), the definitive <em>Tender Comrades: A Backstory of the Hollywood Blacklist</em>.

This work analyzes Dogen&#x2019;s formative doubt concerning the notion of original awakening as the basis for his unique approach to nonduality in the doctrines of the oneness of practice and attainment, the unity of beings and Buddha-nature, the simultaneity of time and eternity, and the identity of life and death. Abe also offers insightful, critical comparisons of Dogen and various Buddhist and Western thinkers, especially Shinran and Heidegger.</p><p>Abe&#39;s studies of Dogen constitute a minor masterpiece within his overall scholarly production.

The mysterious appearance of a twenty-first-century American town (Grantville, West Virginia) in seventeenth-century Germany caused a major uproar, but an alliance with Gustavus Adolphus, the king of Sweden, allowed the displaced Americans to forge a new nation, the USE. But now, a few years later, Adolphus has been marginalized, and his successor, the stoutly antidemocratic Axel Oxenstierna, the Swedish chancellor, is hungry for power and has set his sights on the USE. Byron Chieske, the &#x201c;up-time&#x201d; American cop, and his &#x201c;down-time&#x201d; partner, Gotthilf Hoch, are concerned that some recent cases of sabotage and murder might only be the beginning of a much larger plot.

An excellent account of the charge by the British army's Light [Cavalry] Brigade against the Russian army at the Battle of Balaclava, October 25, 1854, during the Crimean War. Although Tennyson's poem, "The Charge of the Light Brigade," was written to commemorate what he and the British people saw as a great and glorious venture, in reality the battle was the site of one of history's greatest military blunders, a disaster brought about primarily by inept commanders. Bachrach, through her engrossing prose, presents readers with a vivid picture of not only the battle itself but also of the political-historical background. She concludes that the British learned little from the grievous errors made at Balaclava and continued to choose as military leaders those whose noble birth "qualified" them for such positions. The main text is more than adequately supported by an almost minute-by-minute chronology, effectively placed maps and black-and-white archival illustrations, and boxed extras that logically build upon and augment the primary narrative.?David A.

The first is Henry Tandey: an ordinary man, born and brought up in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, who displayed extraordinary courage to emerge from World War&nbsp;I&nbsp;as the most decorated British soldier to survive the war. The second is Adolf Hitler who served in the Great War and went on to become one of the most infamous dictators in history, who brought the world to the brink of destruction during World War II. It seems unlikely that their fates should collide. Yet, in 1938, Hitler named Tandey as the soldier who spared his life in the aftermath of the Battle of Marcoing in September 1918. This book will tell the story of Henry's and Hitler's war, the moment when their lives became intertwined, whether Hitler told the truth about the battle, and how Henry lived with the stigma of being the man who let Hitler live.</p></p><p><b>David Johnson</b>&nbsp;is a World War I&nbsp;historian who&nbsp;became fascinated by the story of Henry Tandey during a visit to Flanders Fields. <b>General Lord Dannatt GCB&nbsp;CBE&nbsp;MC&nbsp;DL</b>&nbsp;is a retired British Army officer.</p><h2>Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart</h2><p>Iris Courtney, a young white woman living in upstate New York in the decade prior to the Civil rights movement, begins a clandestine relationship with Jinx Fairchild, a black man who had defended her in a fatal street fight with a white man</p><p>In addition to many prize-winning and bestselling novels, including&nbsp;<i>We Were the Mulvaneys, Black Water,&nbsp;Because It Is Bitter and Because It Is My Heart</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Broke Heart Blues,</i>&nbsp;<b>Joyce Carol Oates</b>&nbsp;is the author of a number of works of gothic fiction including&nbsp;<i>Haunted: Tales of the Grotesque,</i>&nbsp;a World Fantasy Award nominee; and&nbsp;<i>Zombie</i>, winner of the Bram Stoker Award for Best Horror Novel, awarded by the Horror Writers' Association. In 1994, Oates received the Bram Stoker Lifetime Achievement Award in Horror Fiction. She is the editor of&nbsp;<i>American Gothic Tales</i>. She lives in Princeton, New Jersey.In 1956 in upstate New York, a murder committed in rage binds the lives of a fifteen-year-old white woman and a seventeen-year-old black man forever. Their casual, school acquaintance takes on another dimension as they decide, without words, not to confess the crime. It's a decision that takes a toll on each: for one it means an erosion of self-esteem, for the other it creates a smug but false confidence that they got away with it. Depicting children who come from homes that are struggling financially and emotionally to get by, Joyce Carol Oates explores, through black and white, male and female, and parent and child voices, the impact that parents' decisions have on their children and that children's choices have on their future lives. In this small, industrial town before the Civil Right's movement of the 1960's, the issue of race both confuses and defines many of the characters' actions. <b>Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart</b> looks closely into these young peoples' lives: why they remained silent about the murder, why they felt they had no other options, and what it cost them. At times the reader may want to reach through the pages and shake these people, tell them to see a bigger picture; at the same time, it's hard not to feel absorbed in the characters lives, as though we are making their choices with them. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Holly Smith</i></p><h2>Abraham Lincoln: The Illustrated Edition: The Prairie Years and The War Years</h2><p>Originally published in six volumes, which sold more than one million copies, Carl Sandburg&#x2019;s Pulitzer Prize winner <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> won praise as the most noteworthy historical biography of his generation.

Hector and Virgil think of their B&amp;B as a refuge, a retreat, a haven, where folks may bring their own books or peruse the brothers' own substantial library. An antic blend of homespun and intellectual humor, <i>Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast</i> is a place readers will want to return to again and again.<br></p><p>"One day, I put myself in the car and simply drove. I had no idea where I was going or why. I had no idea ... I would wind up, at dusk, in a lost little valley, turning up the driveway of the Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast." <p> The best books, as you read them, take you from wherever you are to a place where you want to be. If you're a reader of a certain type--a lover of books, cats, and absurdity of a quiet kind--then the <i>Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast</i> should be on your itinerary. It introduces two fraternal twins, Hector and Virgil, unmarried men who run a cozy establishment on a Canadian island. The book alternates between notes from Hector or Virgil, and "Brief Lives," culled from the B &amp; B's guest book. This variety of perspectives gives Bill Richardson tremendous flexibility, and he weaves all the disparate characters together with an unobtrusive dexterity. The <i>Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast</i> is a pleasant, soothing, quietly absurd place to be.</p>Settle in for an amusing visit with Hector and Virgil, the twin hosts of a rustic retreat, and their clientele of bookish and perhaps slightly confused storytellers. No one will forget the romantic (;even shocking); story of how the brothers were conceived, nor their motley inheritance -- a big house on a small island, a huge library, an aged, cussing parrot, and a dozen musical eggcups. The winner of the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour, Bachelor Brothers' Bed &amp;; Breakfast is narrated by the man who knows the place best: writer, broadcaster, and raconteur Bill Richardson. He first entertained listeners about the goings-on of Hector and Virgil on CBC Radio. Then he transformed his sketches into an international best-seller, and now they tickle the ear again.</p><h2>The 5th Wave: The Last Star (Book 3)</h2><p><p><b><i>The Last Star</i></b><b> is the heart-stopping finale to the bestselling 5th Wave series by award-winning author, Rick Yancey.

His debut young-adult novel,<i> The Extraordinary Adventures of Alfred Kropp,</i> was a finalist for the Carnegie Medal. In 2010, his novel <i>The Monstrumologist </i>received the Michael L.

When he isn&#x2019;t writing or thinking about writing or traveling the country talking about writing, Rick is hanging out with his family.1<br> This is my body. <br> In the cave&#x2019;s lowermost chamber, the priest raises the last wa�fer&#x2014;his supply has been exhausted&#x2014;toward the formations that remind him of a dragon&#x2019;s mouth frozen in mid-roar, the growths like teeth glistening red and yellow in the lamplight. <br> The catastrophe of the divine sacrifice by his hands. <br> <i> Take this, all of you, and eat of it . . . </i><br> Then the chalice containing the final drops of wine. <br> <i> Take this, all of you, and drink from it . . . </i><br> Midnight in late November. In the caves below, the small band of survivors will remain warm and hidden with enough supplies to last until spring. No one has died of the plague in months. The worst appears to be over. They are safe here, perfectly safe. <br> <i> With faith in your love and mercy, I eat your body and drink your blood . . . </i><br> His whispers echo in the deep. They clamber up the slick walls, skitter along the narrow passage toward the upper chambers, where his fellow refugees have fallen into a restless sleep. <br> <i> Let it not bring me condemnation, but health in mind and body. </i><br> There is no more bread, no more wine. This is his final communion. <br> <i> May the body of Christ bring me to everlasting life.</i><br> The stale fragment of bread that softens on his tongue. <br> <i> May the blood of Christ bring me to everlasting life. </i><br> The drops of soured wine that burn his throat. <br> God in his mouth. God in his empty stomach. <br> The priest weeps. <br> He pours a few drops of water into the chalice. His hand shakes. He drinks the precious blood commingled with water, then wipes clean the chalice with the purificator. <br> It is finished. The everlasting sacrifice is over. He dabs his cheeks on the same cloth he used to clean the chalice. The tears of man and the blood of God inseparable. Nothing new in that. <br> He wipes clean the paten with the cloth, then stuffs the purifi�cator into the chalice and sets it aside. He pulls the green stole from his neck, folds it carefully, kisses it. He loved everything about being a priest. Loved the Mass most of all. <br> His collar is damp with sweat and tears and loose about his neck: He&#x2019;s lost fifteen pounds since the plague struck and aban�doned his parish to make the hundred-mile journey to the caverns north of Urbana. Along the way he gained many followers&#x2014;over fifty in all, though thirty-two died from the infection before reach�ing safety. As their deaths approached, he spoke the rite, Catholic, Protestant, or Jew, it didn&#x2019;t matter: <i>May the Lord in his love and mercy help you . . . </i>Tracing a cross on their hot foreheads with his thumb. <i>May the Lord who frees you from sin save you . . . </i><br> The blood that seeped from their eyes mixed with the oil he rubbed on their lids. And smoke rolled across open fields and hunkered in woods and capped over roads like ice over languid rivers in deep winter. Fires in Columbus. Fires in Springfield and Dayton. In Huber Heights and London and Fairborn. In Frank�lin and Middletown and Xenia. In the evenings the light from a thousand fires turned the smoke a dusky orange, and the sky sank to an inch above their heads. The priest shuffled through the smoldering landscape with one hand outstretched, pressing a rag over his nose and mouth with the other while tears of protest streamed down his face. Blood crusted beneath his broken nails, blood caked in the lines of his hands and in the soles of his shoes. <i>Not much farther, </i>he encouraged his companions. <i>Keep moving. </i>Along the way, someone nicknamed him Father Moses, for he was leading his people out of the obscurity of smoke and fire to the Promised Land of &#x201c;Ohio&#x2019;s Most Colorful Caverns!&#x201d; <br> People were there, of course, to greet them when they arrived. The priest expected it. A cave does not burn. It is impervious to weather. Best of all, it&#x2019;s easy to defend. After military bases and government buildings, caves were the most popular destinations in the aftermath of the Arrival. <br> Supplies had been gathered, water and nonperishables, blan�kets and bandages and medicines. And weapons, naturally, rifles and pistols and shotguns and many knives. The sick were quaran�tined in the welcome center aboveground, lying in cots arranged between the display shelves of the gift shop, and every day the priest visited them, spoke with them, prayed with them, heard their confessions, delivered communion, whispered the things they wanted to hear: <i>Per sacrosancta humanae reparationis mys�teria . . . By the sacred mysteries of man&#x2019;s redemption . . . </i><br> Hundreds would die before the dying was over. They dug a pit ten feet wide and thirty feet deep to the south of the welcome center to burn them. The fire smoldered day and night, and the smell of burning flesh had become so commonplace, they hardly noticed. <br> Now it&#x2019;s November, and in the lowermost chamber the priest rises. He is not tall; still, he must stoop to avoid smacking his head into the ceiling or against the stone teeth that bristle from the roof of the dragon&#x2019;s mouth. <br> <i> The Mass is ended, go in peace. </i><br> He leaves behind the chalice and the purificator, the paten and his stole. They are relics now, artifacts from an age receding into the past at the speed of light. <i>We began as cave dwellers, </i>the priest thinks as he makes his way toward the surface, <i>and to caves we have returned. </i><br> Even the longest journey is a circle, and history will always cycle back to the place where it began. From the missal: &#x201c;Remem�ber you are dust and unto dust you shall return.&#x201d; <br> And the priest rises like a diver kicking toward the dome of the sky sparkling above the water. <br> Along the narrow passageway that winds gently upward be�tween walls of weeping stone, the floor is as smooth as the lanes of a bowling alley. Only a few months before, schoolchildren on field trips marched in single file, trailing their fingers along the rock face, their eyes searching for monsters in the shadows that pooled in the crevices. They were still young enough to believe in monsters. <br> And the priest rising like a leviathan from the lightless deep. <br> The trail to the surface runs past the Caveman&#x2019;s Couch and the Crystal King, into the Big Room, the main living area for the refu�gees, and finally into the Palace of the Gods, his favorite part of the caverns, where crystalline formations shine like frozen shards of moonlight and the ceiling sensually undulates like waves roll�ing in to shore. Here, close to the surface, the air thins, becomes drier, tinged with the smoke of the fires that still feed upon the world they left behind. <br> <i> Lord, bless these ashes by which we show that we are dust. </i><br> Snatches of prayer run through his mind. Fragments of song. Litanies and blessings and the words of absolution, <i>May God give you pardon and peace, and I absolve you from your sins . . . </i>And from the Bible: &#x201c;I went down to the roots of the mountains; to the land whose bars closed behind me forever.&#x201d; <br> Incense burning in the censer. Soft spring sunlight shattered by stained glass. The creaking of the pews on Sunday like the hull of an ancient vessel far at sea. The stately measure of the seasons, the calendar that governed his life from the time he was an infant, Advent, Christmas, Lent, Easter. He knows he loved the wrong things, the rituals and traditions, the pomp and foppery for which outsiders faulted the Church. He adored the form, not the sub�stance; the bread, not the body. <br> It didn&#x2019;t make him a bad priest. He was quiet and humble and faithful to his calling. He enjoyed helping people. These weeks in the cave had been some of the most fulfilling of his life. Suffering brings God to his natural home, the manger of terror and confu�sion, pain and loss, where he was born. <i>Turn over the currency of suffering, </i>the priest thinks, <i>and you will see his face. </i><br> A watchman sits just inside the opening above the Palace of the Gods, his burly frame silhouetted against the spray of stars beyond him. The sky has been scrubbed clean by a stiff north wind auguring winter. The man wears a baseball cap pulled low over his forehead, and a worn leather jacket. He&#x2019;s holding a pair of binoculars. A rifle rests in his lap. <br> The man nods a hello to the priest. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your coat, Father? It&#x2019;s a cold one tonight.&#x201d; <br> The priest smiles wanly. &#x201c;I lent it to Agatha, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d; <br> The man grunts his understanding. Agatha is the complainer of the group. Always cold.&nbsp;Always hungry. Always <i>something. </i>He lifts the binoculars to his eyes and scans the sky. <br> &#x201c;Have you seen any more of them?&#x201d; the priest asks. They spotted the first grayish-silver, cigar-shaped object a week before, hanging motionlessly above the caverns for several minutes be�fore silently shooting straight up, dwindling to a pinprick scar in the vast blue. Another&#x2014;or the same one&#x2014;appeared two days later, gliding soundlessly over them until it dropped beneath the horizon. There was no question about the origin of these strange craft&#x2014;the cave dwellers knew they weren&#x2019;t terrestrial&#x2014;it was the mystery of their purpose that frightened them. <br> The man lowers the binoculars and rubs his eyes. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter, Father? Can&#x2019;t sleep?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t sleep much these days,&#x201d; the priest says. Then he adds, &#x201c;So much to do.&#x201d; He doesn&#x2019;t want the man to think he&#x2019;s complaining. <br> &#x201c;No atheists in foxholes.&#x201d; The clich� hangs in the air like a rancid smell. <br> &#x201c;Or in caves,&#x201d; the priest says. Since they met, he has strained to know this man better, but he is a closed room, the door se�curely dead-bolted by anger and grief and the hopeless dread of the doomed living on borrowed time. For months there&#x2019;s been no turning from it or hiding from it. For some, death is the midwife to faith. For others, it is faith&#x2019;s executioner. <br> The man pulls a pack of gum from his breast pocket, carefully unwraps a piece, and folds it into his mouth. He counts the re�maining sticks before slipping the pack back into his pocket. He does not offer any to the priest. <br> &#x201c;My last pack,&#x201d; the man says in explanation. He shifts his weight on the cold stone.<br> &#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; the priest says. <br> &#x201c;Do you?&#x201d; The man&#x2019;s jaw moves with a hypnotic rhythm as he chews. &#x201c;Do you really?&#x201d; <br> The dry bread, the soured wine: The taste lingers on his tongue. The bread could have been broken; the wine could have been di�vided. He did not have to celebrate the Mass alone. &#x201c;I believe that I do,&#x201d; the little priest answers. <br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; the man says slowly and deliberately. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe in a goddamned thing.&#x201d; <br> The priest blushes. His soft, embarrassed laughter is like the patter of children&#x2019;s feet up a long staircase. He touches his collar nervously. <br> &#x201c;When the power died, I believed it would come back on,&#x201d; the man with the rifle says. &#x201c;Everybody did. The power goes out&#x2014;the power comes back on. That&#x2019;s faith, right?&#x201d; He gnawed the gum, left side, right side, pushing the green knob back and forth with his tongue. &#x201c;Then the news trickles in from the coasts that there are no coasts anymore. Now Reno is prime oceanfront property. Big deal; so what? There&#x2019;ve been earthquakes before. There&#x2019;ve been tsunamis. Who needs New York? What&#x2019;s so special about Califor�nia? We&#x2019;ll bounce back. We always bounce back. I believed that.&#x201d; <br> The watchman is nodding, staring at the night sky, at the cold, blazing stars. Eyes high, voice low. &#x201c;Then people got sick. Anti�biotics. Quarantines. Disinfectants. We put on masks and washed our hands until our skin peeled off. Most of us died anyway.&#x201d; <br> And the man with the rifle watches the stars as if waiting for them to shake loose from the black and tumble to the Earth. Why shouldn&#x2019;t they? <br> &#x201c;My neighbors. My friends. My wife and kids. I knew that <i>all </i>of them wouldn&#x2019;t die. How could <i>all </i>of them die? Some people will get sick, but most people won&#x2019;t, and the rest will get better, right? That&#x2019;s faith. That&#x2019;s what we believed.&#x201d; <br> The man pulls a large hunting knife from his boot and begins to clean the dirt from beneath his nails with its tip. <br> &#x201c;This is faith: You grow up; you go to school. Find a job. Get married. Start a family.&#x201d; Finishing the job on one hand, a nail for each rite of passage, then beginning on the other. &#x201c;Your kids grow up. They go to school. They find a job. They get married. They start a family.&#x201d; <i>Scrape, scrape. Scrape, scrape, scrape. </i>He pushes his hat back with the heel of the hand that wields the knife. &#x201c;I was never what you&#x2019;d call a religious person. Haven&#x2019;t seen the inside of a church in twenty years. But I know what faith is, Fa�ther. I know what it is to believe in something. The lights go out, they come back on. The floodwaters roll in, they roll out again. Folks get sick, they get better. Life goes on. That&#x2019;s true faith, isn&#x2019;t it? Your mumbo-jumbo about heaven and hell, sin and salvation, throw it all out and you&#x2019;re still left with that. Even your biggest church-bashing atheist has faith in that. Life will go on.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; the priest says. &#x201c;Life will go on.&#x201d; <br> The watchman bares his teeth. He jabs the knife toward the priest&#x2019;s chest and snarls, &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t heard a damn word I&#x2019;ve said. See, this is why I can&#x2019;t stand your kind. You light your can�dles and mumble your Latin spells and pray to a god who isn&#x2019;t there, doesn&#x2019;t care, or is just plain crazy or cruel or both. The world burns and you praise the asshole who either set it or let it.&#x201d; <br> The little priest has raised his hands, the same hands that con�secrated the bread and wine, as if to show the man that they are empty, that he means no harm. <br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t pretend to know the mind of God,&#x201d; the priest begins, lowering his hands. Eyeing the knife, he quotes from the Book of Job: &#x201c;&#x2018;Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br> The man stares at him for a very long, very uncomfortable moment, absolutely still except for his jaw working the already tasteless knob of gum. <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be honest with you, Father,&#x201d; he says matter-of-factly. &#x201c;I feel like killing you right now.&#x201d; <br> The priest nods somberly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid that may happen. When the truth hits home.&#x201d; <br> He eases the knife from the man&#x2019;s shaking hand. The priest touches the man&#x2019;s shoulder. <br> The man flinches but doesn&#x2019;t pull away. &#x201c;What is the truth?&#x201d; the man whispers. <br> &#x201c;This,&#x201d; the little priest answers, and drives the knife deep into the man&#x2019;s chest. <br> The blade is very sharp&#x2014;it slides through the man&#x2019;s shirt easily, gliding between the ribs before sinking three inches into the heart. <br> The priest pulls the man to his chest and kisses the top of his head. <i>May God give you pardon and peace. </i><br> It is over quickly. The gum drops from the man&#x2019;s slackened lips, and the priest picks it up and tosses it through the cave&#x2019;s mouth. He eases the man onto the cold stone floor and stands up. The wet knife glimmers in his hand. <i>The blood of the new and everlasting covenant . . . </i><br> The priest studies the dead man&#x2019;s face, and his heart burns with rage and revulsion. The human face is hideous, unendurably gro�tesque. No need to hide his disgust anymore. <br> The little priest returns to the Big Room, following a well-worn path into the main chamber, where the others twitch and turn in restless sleep. All except Agatha, who ...</p><h2>Batman Beyond Vol. 2: City of Yesterday</h2><p>THE WAR IS OVER.<br><br> RECONSTRUCTION BEGINS...<br><br> He won the fight of his life, but Tim Drake is still a man lost in time.

When word gets out, academics from the studiums across Orion scramble to gain the Entity&#x2019;s favor. However, not all the sentients of Orion hold this "god" in awe some, like the philosophers of Scolar and the Transhumans of Extropy are deeply suspicious. Onto the grand stage of interplanetary academic politics, intellectual conceit, and dubious theology walks Baronessa Mira Fedor. Her planet has been torn apart by the invasion of a race of giant tardigrades. Only the Orion League of Sentient Species can lend aid, but OLOSS is preoccupied with communicating with God. Mira, together with the rowdy, misogynist Jo-Jo Rasterovich, is left to her own resources to find help. In doing so she unmasks a galaxy-sized intrigue. But will she live long enough to tell anyone?</p><p>Marianne de Pierres is the author of the Parrish Plessis series&#x2014;<i>Code Noir</i>, <i>Crash Deluxe</i>, and <i>Nylon Angel&#x2014;</i>which has been adapted into a role-playing game.Dark Space is an exciting adventure with plenty going on to keep you turning the pages. The story is primed to enter uncharted territory at the end of Book One. Marianne has a knack for creating compelling characters in complex realities-the Parish Pless * AUREALIS * A complex and exciting novel, almost devoid of cheap sentiment and comfortable vindication. It&#39;s not a cheerful read, but it is a very rewarding one . . . de Pierre s&#39; willingness to display the imperfections of her characters is a large part of the appeal of Dark Space; she deftly handles the aspects of bringing characters to life that elude so many space opera writers, simply by making them genuinely human - with all the contradictory drives and motives that implies . . . While a deeply political book, Dark Space is also a very engaging one - the fine characterisation and subtle writing make for a novel which is both exciting and thought-provoking at once . . . It&#39;s always a joy to find intelligent and exciting space opera; to find it being written by a woman unafraid to bring her own perspective to a traditionally masculine genre, doubly so. * SCALPEL MAGAZINE * Dark Space is a rich and vigorous adventure and a promising first instalment * THE AUSTRALIAN * DARK SPACE lacks focus, but the colourful characters and sense of scale suggest that the series could develop into something special * TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT *</p><h2>The Witchcraft Delusion: The Story of the Witchcraft Persecutions in Seventeenth-Century New England, Including Original Trial Transcripts</h2><p>Witchcraft is as old as human history, states John M. Taylor. &#34;It has written its name in the oldest of human records. In all ages and among all peoples it has taken firm hold on the fears, convictions, and consciences of men.&#34; In colonial New England, laws against witchcraft were passed in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Haven in the mid-seventeenth century. The most notorious episode of persecution occurred in 1692 in Salem, where 20 persons were executed as witches. From the 1660s to the 1690s, there were ongoing witch-hunts and trials in the colonies of Connecticut and New Haven. Several chapters of The Witchcraft Delusion are devoted exclusively to these accounts, most of which have been selected from colonial records and from original depositions. Each of the cases is presented using actual trial testimony. In addition to trial transcripts, there are such documents as the guide to discovering, accusing, and examining a witch prepared by William Jones, a deputy governor of C</p><p></p><h2>Blinded by Might: Can the Religious Right Save America?</h2><p>Discusses why the Moral Majority has failed to accomplish its goals after two decades of political maneurvering</p><p>Two "insiders" from the religious right explore why the Moral Majority has failed to accomplish its goals despite two decades of aggressive political maneuvering. Although the authors reveal secrets and lies, such as the fact that most of the Moral Majority's so-called "state chapters" are "little more than a separate telephone line in a pastor's office," this is not a tawdry kiss and tell book. In fact, Dobson and Thomas strongly support most of the Christian values behind the organization's political machinery. But they have come to believe that politics is too corrupt and distorted an arena for Christians to use to enact social change. <p> Ed Dobson, who helped draft the Moral Majority platform and served as personal assistant to Jerry Falwell, offers a particularly compelling chapter in which he compares the U.S. to Northern Ireland, where Dobson grew up as a Protestant. "We have politicized the gospel with our agendas," he writes. "To be part of the Christian right is to be part of the Republican party. For some, this means to be a <i>real</i> Christian, you must be a Republican. That is heresy and is only a short distance from the extremism of my Irish counterparts." </p><p> Ultimately, devout Christians and the people they are trying to influence are the most hurt by the corruption of church through politics, according to coauthor Cal Thomas, a former spokesperson for the Moral Majority. For example, by making the Pro-Life movement a political issue, he claims the Christian right has lost sight of more supportive antiabortion tactics, such as focusing on offering homes and finding jobs for destitute single mothers. Ultimately, the duo calls for a change in strategy--hoping to create followers of the Christian agenda through positive example, consistent living, and devout faith rather than brute political force. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>It was 1980. They had just helped to elect their president, Ronald Reagan. They had millions of dollars, the attention of the national media, and a supposed army of mobilized followers. This was their moment to reverse decades of creeping secularism, intrusive socialism, threatening communism, and raging humanism. They called themselves the Moral Majority. But they failed. They failed in their first stated objectives to end abortion, eliminate pornography, restore the shattered American family, and usher in a better world in which traditional values were not only accepted but embraced. What happened? Why is America no better--and probably worse--after nearly twenty years of vigorous, sophisticated, and relentless political action by the church? Blinded by Might is the story of two men who were at the center of the Moral Majority. Cal Thomas and Ed Dobson, behind-the-scenes lieutenants to the architects of the religious right, argue that the reason the Moral Majority or any other religious-political movement cannot succeed is because they have been using the wrong tools in the wrong way for the wrong reasons. The authors retrace their own steps, showing why the efforts of people like Jerry Falwell, Ralph Reed, and James Dobson were doomed from the start. They disclose never-reported inside information on a movement that they helped create in order to show why it failed. And they use their mistakes and the mistakes of others to point people of faith in a more positive direction. The authors call for unilateral disarmament by the religious right and a re-armament using different weapons and different strategies. This stirring book offers a new vision for America from the architects of the Moral Majority. And it shows how conservative Christianity offers hope for lasting transformation through the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><h2>Voices of the American West, Volume 2: The Settler and Soldier Interviews of Eli S. Ricker, 1903-1919</h2><p>In this second volume of interviews conducted by Nebraska judge Eli S. Ricker, he focuses on white eyewitnesses and participants in the occupying and settling of the American West in the nineteenth century. <br>In the first decade of the twentieth century, as the Old West became increasingly distant and romanticized in popular consciousness, Eli S. Ricker (1842&#x2013;1926) began interviewing those who had experienced it firsthand, hoping to write a multivolume series about its last days, centering on the conflicts between Natives and outsiders. For years Ricker traveled across the northern Plains, gathering information on and off reservations, in winter and in summer. Judge Ricker never wrote his book, but his interviews are priceless sources of information about that time and place, and they offer more balanced perspectives on events than were accepted at the time. <br>Richard E. Jensen brings together all of Ricker&#x2019;s interviews with those men and women who came to the American West from elsewhere&#x2014;settlers, homesteaders, and veterans. These interviews shed light on such key events as the massacre at Wounded Knee, the Little Bighorn battle, Beecher Island, Lightning Creek, the Mormon cow incident, and the Washita massacre. Also of interest are glimpses of everyday life at different agencies, including Pine Ridge, Yellow Medicine, and Fort Sill School; brief though revealing memoirs; and snapshots of cattle drives, conflicts with Natives, and the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad.</p><p>Richard E. Jensen is retired from the Nebraska State Historical Society, where he was senior research anthropologist. His most recent books are <i>The Pawnee Mission Letters, 1834&#x2013;1851 </i>and <i>Eyewitness at Wounded Knee</i>, both available from the University of Nebraska Press.&#x201c;A magnificent achievement to the oral-history sources available on the American West. This collection of Ricker&#x2019;s interviews provides a rich resource on the Old West for the scholar and those interested in an accurate analysis of the lives of Indians, soldiers and settlers. . . . The strength of the volumes is in the stories told by the interviewees, with their perspectives on key historical events from the Old West, which is equally suited to the student and the academic scholar.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>American Studies</i> (<i>American Studies</i> 2007-09-06)<br><br>&#x201c;The interviews are a gold mine of information, and researchers will be rewarded for digging through them. Jensen has helped a great deal by organizing the book into three main chapters subdivided by respondent and topic. . . . Ricker left Nebraska and the West an important source of information, and Jensen has made this more user-friendly by his organization and commentary.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Great Plains Quarterly</i> (<i>Great Plains Quarterly</i> 2007-08-29)<br><br>&#x201c;Amazing personal accounts [are] in these volumes, which present for the first time the extensive turn-of-the-century interviews of Eli S. Ricker, a pioneering Nebraska judge and newspaperman who traveled across the Dakotas a hundred years ago, interviewing the last of the old-timers on the northern prairie. . . . Here are the authentic voices of the real people who were actually there at Beecher&#x2019;s Island, Little Bighorn, and Wounded Knee. Here is western history at its finest--vivid oral narratives that very well may become the stuff of prize-winning stories, novels, and films.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Bloomsbury Review</i> (<i>Bloomsbury Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Ricker proved himself a patient and meticulous oral interviewer, giving voice to people mostly ignored by historians of his day. His subjects document the Ghost Dance as a genuine religious movement, not as a &#x2018;craze&#x2019; as described in white accounts. . . . Editor Richard Jensen provides a true service, for having translated Ricker&#x2019;s arcane handwritten notes into readable form and for his endnotes filled with biographical information.&#x201d;&#x2014;James N.

From 1851 to 1866 he served as the official sculptor of Paris's National History Museum, creating a series of spectacularly lifelike busts for their new ethnographic gallery (now housed in the Musee de l'Homme, Paris). <br><br>The Musee d'Orsay in Paris has organized an unprecedented exhibition of Cordier's work, highlighting seventy-five sculptures and almost forty ethnographic photographs. Filled with several texts on his life and work compiled by the exhibition's organizers, this book serves as the official exhibition catalogue but also includes a catalogue raisonne of six hundred of Cordier's works, of which four hundred are reproduced.</p><p>Christine Barthe is head of the photography collection of the Musee de l&#39;Homme, Paris.

Do you? If you want to stop fighting about sex and revitalize your intimate connection with your spouse, then you need this book. But <i>The Sex-Starved Marriage</i> is not just another book explaining the reasons you or your spouse might not be in the mood for sex. Bestselling author Michele Weiner Davis will help you understand why being complacent or bitter about ho-hum sex might cost you your marriage, and with her acclaimed psychobabble-free, straight-shooting advice, she'll show you how to bring the spark back into your bedroom and into your relationship. </p><p> Because relationship expert Weiner Davis is convinced that feeling sexy is a two-person job, she looks at the problem of -- and the solution to -- low sexual desire from a couple's perspective. Whether you're someone whose passion has faded or someone who's been hungering for touch, you'll learn life-altering lessons about bridging the desire gap and restoring intimacy and friendship to your marriage. And because Weiner Davis knows that one spouse is often more motivated than the other to work on a relationship, she offers creative ways to inspire your partner to change. </p><p> Separate chapters address the spouse who's hot, the one who's not, and then both together. If you're the spouse with a lagging libido, you're far from alone. And if you're a man, you'll be surprised to learn that staggering numbers of men, even men whose sexual machinery works just fine, "get headaches" too! </p><p> If you're the low-desire spouse, you'll learn about the physiological and psychological factors, including unresolved relationship issues, that may contribute to the chill in your bedroom. You'll learn the truth about sexual desire: that for millions of men or women it doesn't just happen; you have to <i>make</i> it happen. Finally, you'll find specific, pragmatic, and often provocative solutions to help you discover the siren or seducer within. </p><p> If you're the more highly sexed partner, you'll breathe a sigh of relief. At last someone understands your feelings about the void in your marriage. Discover why your pleas for touch have fallen upon deaf ears and why your approach to the lull in your sexual relationship could be a sexual turnoff. Most important, you'll find tools you can use to reach out in ways that will make your spouse more responsive. Finally, if your partner is willing, you will learn how to keep the flame of desire burning <i>together.</i> </p><p> Full of moving firsthand accounts from couples who have struggled with the erosion of sexual desire and rebuilt their passionate connection, <i>The Sex-Starved Marriage</i> will give you and your spouse the inspiration, encouragement, and answers you need to find your way out of a sex-starved marriage.</p></p><p>In contrast to its tabloid title, <i>The Sex-Starved Marriage</i> offers candid and sensible counsel for couples with mismatched libidos. Seasoned sex therapist Michele Weiner-Davis skewers two stereotypes about sex in marriage. First, she jettisons the idea that husbands are hot and wives are not, giving examples of "low-desire" men in her practice. Next, she upends the longstanding model of sexual response and advises readers: "Just do it. Desire is a decision. Once the low-interest partner allows him/herself to be touched and aroused, this will trigger a strong desire to continue being sexual." The strength of her approach to the causes of sexual stalemate lies in her insights about the struggles of both partners. Her suggestions (how to break the ice, how to court your partner, nag busting, and the Hallmark solution) are not gimmicky and are presented as techniques for couples, not individuals. Weakened only by a final chapter--one that discloses too many details about the author&#x2019;s marriage--this perceptive book will inspire couples to add heat and light to their marriage. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i><b>Michele Weiner Davis</b> is the author of <i>The Divorce Remedy, Divorce Busting, A Woman's Guide to Changing Her Man, Change Your Life and Everyone in It,</i> and <i>In Search of Solutions.</i> A regular guest on <i>Oprah, 48 Hours,</i> the <i>Today show,</i> and <i>CBS This Morning,</i> she created <i>Keeping Love Alive,</i> a PBS broadcast seminar.

In response, Peter J. Katzenstein and Robert O. Keohane have assembled a distinguished group of experts, including historians, polling-data analysts, political scientists, anthropologists, and sociologists, to explore anti-Americanism in depth, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The result is a book that probes deeply a central aspect of world politics that is frequently noted yet rarely understood. </p><p>Katzenstein and Keohane identify several quite different anti-Americanisms-liberal, social, sovereign-nationalist, and radical. Some forms of anti-Americanism respond merely to what the United States does, and could change when U.S. policies change. Other forms are reactions to what the United States is, and involve greater bias and distrust. The complexity of anti-Americanism, they argue, reflects the cultural and political complexities of American society. The analysis in this book leads to a surprising discovery: there are as many ways to be anti-American as there are ways to be American.</p></p><p>&#34;Whereas most other books on the topic either focus on anti-Americanism in one country or analyze it as a single worldwide phenomenon, this book makes a signfiicant contribution by explicitly comparing the intensity of anti-American views across countries and regions and by emphasizing the variety of attitudes toward America even within one society.&#34;-Ido Oren, University of Florida<p>Peter J.

A strategically located and vital center, Susa absorbed diverse influences and underwent great political fluctuations during the several thousand years of its history. When French archaeologists began to excavate its site in the nineteenth century, the astonishing abundance of finds greatly expanded our understanding of the ancient Near East. The artifacts were taken to Paris through diplomatic agreement and became a centerpiece of the Louvre's great collection of Near Eastern antiquities. These works are rarely loaned, but a remarkable selection that includes many undisputed masterpieces, brought to The Metropolitan Museum of Art for exhibition, is presented in this comprehensive publication.<br>Susa was settled about 4000 B.C. and has yielded striking pottery finds from that prehistoric period. A rich production followed of objects for daily use, ritual, and luxury living, finely carved in various materials or fashioned of clay. Monumental sculpture was made in stone or bronze, and dramatic friezes were composed of brilliantly glazed bricks. Among the discoveries are tiny, intricately carved cylinder seals and splendid jewelry. Clay balls marked with symbols offer fascinating testimony to the very beginnings of writing; clay tablets from later periods bearing inscriptions in cuneiform record political history, literature, business transactions, and mathematical calculations.<br>A very important group of finds from Susa is made up of objects brought back as booty from conquests in Mesopotamia. These works, many of them the royal monuments of Akkadian and Babylonian monarchs - for instance, the great stele of Naram-Sin - are among the best known of all objects from the ancient Near East.<br>Altogether, the exhibition presents more than two hundred objects found at Susa, produced over a period of about 3500 years. They come from all periods of the site's settlement, from it earliest history to its adornment as a major city of the opulent Achaemenid Persian empire.<br>Eighteen French and American scholars have contributed essays to this volume on subjects that include the history of art in ancient Iran from prehistoric settlement through the Achaemenid period; the history of the excavations at Susa; the development of writing; seals and sealings; royal and religious structures at Susa; objects brought from Mesopotamia; brick decoration; popular art; and cuneiform texts. Recent results of ongoing research into the archaeology of Susa are discussed. Analyses of specific techniques are included as well as reports on the conservation of objects. Each work in the exhibition is illustrated and fully described, with references to relevant publications.</p><p>This comprehensive catalog documents an exhibition, held this winter at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, of 195 rarely loaned Susa masterpieces from the Louvre's Near Eastern antiquities collection. Settled about 200 B.C., Susa lay at the edge of the Iranian plateau, not far from the great centers of the Mesopotamian culture. During the several thousand years of its history, Susa absorbed diverse influences and underwent great political fluctuations. Introductory chapters on Susa, Iranian art, and the 19th-century French excavations are followed by item-by-item descriptions of objects ranging from prehistoric pottery to monumental sculpture, stelae, glazed brick friezes, intricate cylinder seals, and exquisite jewelry. Of broad appeal to archaeologists, art historians, and Near East specialists.<br><i>- Russell T. Clement, Brigham Young Univ.

At stake was control of rich resources--gold and diamonds--and strategic advantage.<br><br>Canada was divided. Many Canadians wanted to see their country prove its loyalty to the Empire by sending troops to fight alongside the British. Others felt Canada had no quarrel with the Boers, and no justification for taking up arms against them and their much-demonized leader.<br><br>In the end, the Canadian government sent 7,000 Canadian troops to South Africa, to augment a British force 200,000 strong. Some contributed to conventional military victories; others became part of a horrifying 'dirty war,' where the British used scorched-earth tactics and created concentration camps that imprisoned women and children. Canadian experiences both home and abroad foreshadowed their experiences in the great conflagration to come, the First World War.</p><p>CARMAN MILLER is a professor of history and the former Dean of Arts at McGill University.

He was Chancellor of the Exchequer and when he spoke in the House of Commons, MPs of every party flocked to hear his oratory. The leadership of the all-powerful Conservative party seemed within his grasp. A year later, however, all had changed. The Conservatives themselves were defeated, and out of office, Churchill found himself at odds with the leadership, especially over the future of India. When the National Government was formed in 1931, Churchill was not asked to join it. Thereafter, though out on his own, Churchill&#39;s acute political sense, foresight and courage were undiminished. Fed with secret inside information by a small, brave band of men - some of them risking their careers to help him - Churchill consistently warned of the Nazi danger, even before the rise of Hitler. And once Hitler came to power, he stepped up his attacks on Britain&#39;s failure to rearm. His message was belittled by the Government, which fought him at every turn, even refusing him the right to broadcast. But Churchill never gave up. Despite all the Government&#39;s efforts, and as a result of Churchill&#39;s courage and perseverance, the British public came to realize the truth of his warnings; the bond was formed that was to be so vital in the years that followed, when Britain and Churchill stood together, but alone.</p><p>Martin Gilbert was born in London in 1936.

They live in Washington State and in the winter&nbsp;they live in&nbsp;Florida.<br><br>A robust version of "Little Drummer Boy" played in the background as Len Dawber glanced at his watch&#x2014;for at least the tenth time in five minutes. He looked around the depot impatiently, hardly noticing the Christmas decorations on the windows and walls&#x2014;the cardboard Santa's sleigh, the drooping garland and blinking lights.<br><br>Len was waiting with a herd of other holiday travelers to board the train that would take him to Boston. The snowstorm that had started last evening meant his early-morning flight out of Bangor, Maine, had been canceled and the airport closed. Although the airlines couldn't be blamed for the weather, they'd done everything possible to arrange transportation out of Maine. Len suspected more than a few strings had been pulled to get seats on the already full midmorn-ing train. Maybe some of the original passengers canceled, he thought with faint hope.<br><br>Because, unfortunately, that crowded train was his only chance of making it to Boston in time to connect with his flight home for Christmas.<br><br>Len got to his feet, relinquishing his place on the hard station bench to a tired-looking man. He walked quickly to the door and stepped outside. He lifted his gaze toward the sky. Huge flakes of snow swirled in the wind, obscuring his view. His shoulder muscles tensed with frustration until he could no longer remain still. This was exactly what he'd feared would happen when he'd awakened that morning. Even then the clouds had been dark and ominous, threatening his plans and his dreams of a reunion with Amy.<br><br>Despite the snow that stung his eyes and dampened his hair, Len began to pace back and forth along the platform, peering down the tracks every few seconds. No train yet. Damn it! Stuck in New England on Christmas Eve.<br><br>This was supposed to be the season of joy, but there was little evidence of that in the faces around him. Most people were burdened with luggage and armfuls of Christmas packages. Some of the gift wrap was torn, the bows limp and tattered. The children, sensing their parents' anxiety, were cranky and restless. The younger ones whined and clung to their mothers.<br><br>Worry weighed on Len's heart. He <em>had </em>to catch the Boston flight, otherwise he wouldn't make it home to Rawhide, Texas, today. He'd miss his date with Amy and the family's Christmas Eve celebration. Part of his precious leave would be squandered because of the snowstorm.<br><br>There was another reason he yearned for home. Len didn't intend this to be an ordinary Christmas. No, this Christmas would be one of the best in his entire life. It had everything to do with Amy&#x2014;and the engagement ring burning a hole in his uniform pocket.<br><br>Len had enlisted in the navy following high-school graduation and taken his submarine training in New London, Connecticut. Afterward, he'd been assigned to the sub base in Bangor, Maine. He thoroughly enjoyed life on the East Coast, so different from anything he'd known in Texas, and wondered if Amy would like it, too....<br><br>Len was proud to serve his country and seriously considered making the navy his career, but that decision depended on a number of things. Amy's answer, for one.<br><br>A real drawback of military life was this separation from his family. On his most recent trip home last September, he'd come to realize how much he loved Amy Brent. In the weeks since, he'd decided to ask her to marry him. They planned to be together that very night, Christmas Eve&#x2014;the most wonderful night of the year. Once they were alone, away from family and friends, Len intended to propose.<br><br>He loved Amy; he had no doubts about that. He wasn't a man who gave his heart easily, and he'd made sure, in his own mind at least, that marriage was what he truly wanted. In the weeks since their last meeting, he'd come to see that loving her was for real and for always.<br><br>They hadn't talked about marriage, not the way some couples did, but he was confident she loved him, too. He paused for a moment and held in a sigh as the doubts came at him, thick as the falling snow. Lately Len had noticed that Amy seemed less like her normal self. They hadn't talked much, not with him saving to buy the diamond. And it was difficult for Amy to call him at the base. So they'd exchanged letters&#x2014;light newsy letters with little mention of feelings. He had to admit he found their letters enjoyable to read&#x2014;and even to write&#x2014;and the cost of stamps was a lot more manageable than some of his phone bills had been. The truth was, he couldn't afford to spend money on long-distance calls anymore, not the way he had in previous months. His airfare home hadn't been cheap, either.<br><br>It wasn't as if he'd put off traveling until the last minute, which Amy seemed to suspect. He'd been on duty until the wee hours of this morning; he'd explained all that in a letter he'd mailed earlier in the week, when he'd sent her his flight information. Although Amy hadn't come right out and said it, he knew she'd been disappointed he couldn't arrive earlier, but that was navy life.<br><br>He hadn't received a letter from her in ten days, which was unusual. Then again, perhaps not. After all, they'd be seeing each other soon. Amy and his parents were scheduled to pick him up in Dallas, and together they'd drive home to Rawhide. He closed his eyes and pictured their reunion, hoping the mental image would help calm his jangled nerves. It did soothe him, but not for long.<br><br>He had to get home for Christmas. He just had to.<br><br>This was Cathy Norris's first Christmas without Ron, and she refused to spend it in Maine. She'd buried her husband of forty-one years that October; her grief hadn't even begun to abate. The thought of waking up Christmas morning without him had prompted her to accept her daughter's invitation. She'd be joining Madeline and her young family in Boston for the holidays.<br><br>Cathy had postponed the decision until last week for a number of reasons. To begin with, she wasn't a good traveler and tended to stay close to home. Ron, on the other hand, had adored adventure and loved trekking through the woods and camping and fishing with his friends. Cathy was more of a homebody. She'd never flown or taken the train by herself be-fore&#x2014;but then, she was learning, now, to do a great many unfamiliar things on her own. In the past Ron had always been with her, seeing to their tickets, their luggage and any unforeseen problems. He had been such a dear husband, so thoughtful and generous.<br><br>The battle with cancer had been waged for a year. Ron had put up a gallant fight, but in the end he'd been ready to die, far more ready than she was to let him go. Trivial as it seemed now, she realized that subconsciously she'd wanted him to live until after the holidays.<br><br>Naturally she'd never said anything. How could she, when such a request was purely selfish? It wasn't as if Ron could choose when he would die. Nevertheless, she'd clung to him emotionally far longer than she should have&#x2014;until she'd painfully acknowledged that her fears were denying her husband a peaceful exit from life. Then with an agony that had all but crippled her, she'd kissed him one final time. Holding his limp hand between her own, she'd sat by his bedside, loving him with her entire being, and waited until he'd breathed his last.<br><br>Ron's death clouded what would otherwise have been her favorite month of the year. She found it devastating to be around others celebrating the season while she struggled to shake her all-consuming grief. She'd accepted Madeline's invitation as part of a concerted effort to survive the season of peace and goodwill.<br><br>Charting a new course for herself at this age was more of a challenge than she wanted. Life, however, had seen fit to make her a widow one month, then thrust her into the holiday season the next.<br><br>She was doing her best, trying to cope with her grief, finding the courage to smile now and again for her children's sake. They realized how difficult the holidays were for her of course, but her daughters were grieving, too.<br><br>This snowstorm had been an unwelcome hitch in her careful plans. Madeline had urged her to come sooner, but Cathy had foolishly resisted, not wanting to overstay her welcome. She'd agreed to visit until the twenty-seventh. Ron had always said that company, like fish, began to smell after three days.<br><br>"Mom," Madeline had said when she'd phoned early that morning, "I heard on the news there's a huge snowstorm headed your way."<br><br>"I'm afraid it arrived last night." The wind had moaned audibly outside her window as she spoke.<br><br>"What are you going to do?" Madeline, her youngest, tended to worry; unfortunately she'd inherited that trait from her mother.<br><br>"Do?" Cathy repeated as if a fierce winter blizzard was of little concern. "I'm taking the train to Boston to join you, Brian and the children for Christmas. What else is there to do?"<br><br>"But how will you get to the station?"<br><br>Cathy had already worked that out. "I've phoned for a taxi."<br><br>"But, Mom&#x2014;"<br><br>"I'm sure everything will be fine," Cathy said firmly, hoping she sounded confident even though she was an emotional wreck. She felt as though her life was caving in around her. Stuck in Bangor over Christmas, grieving for Ron&#x2014;that would have been more than Cathy could handle. If spending the holiday with family meant taking her chances in the middle of a snowstorm, then so be it.<br><br>The first hurdle had been successfully breached. Listening to Andy Williams crooning a Christmas ballad, Cathy stood in line at the Bangor train depot, along with half the town, it seemed. The taxi fare had been exorbitant, but at least she was here, safe and sound. She'd packed light, leaving plenty of room in her suitcase for gifts for her two youngest granddaughters. Shopping had been a chore this year, so she'd decided simply to give Madeline and Brian a check and leave it at that, but she couldn't give money to her grandchildren. They were much too young for that. The best gifts she could think to bring them were books, plus a toy each.<br><br>Madeline had consented to let Lindsay and Angela, aged three and five, open their presents that evening following church services. Then the children could climb onto Cathy's lap and she'd read them to sleep. The thought of holding her grandchildren close helped ease the ache in her heart.<br><br>Everything would be all right now that she was at the depot, she reassured herself. Soon she'd be with her family. The train might be late, but it would get there eventually.<br><br>All her worries had been for nothing.<br><br>Matthew McHugh hated Christmas. And he didn't have a problem expressing that opinion. As for the season of goodwill&#x2014;what a laugh. Especially now, when he was stuck in an overcrowded train depot, waiting for the next train to Boston where he'd catch the flight into LAX. The timing of this snowstorm had been impeccable. Every seat in the station was taken, and people who weren't sitting nervously paced the confined area, waiting for the train, which was already fifteen minutes late. Some, like that guy in the navy uniform, were even prowling the plat-form&#x2014;as though <em>that </em>would make the train come any faster.<br><br>Christmas Eve, and the airports, train depots and bus stations were jammed. Everyone was in a rush to get somewhere, him included. As a sales rep for a Los Angeles-based software company, Matt was a seasoned traveler. And he figured anyone who spent a lot of time in airports would agree: Christmas was the worst. Crying babies, little old ladies, cranky kids&#x2014;he'd endured it all. Most of it with ill grace.<br><br>His boss, Ruth Shroeder, who'd been promoted over him, had handed him this assignment early in the week. She'd purposely sent him to the other side of the country just so he'd know <em>she </em>was in charge.<br><br>Rub his face in it, so to speak. This could easily have been a wasted trip; no one bought computer software three days before Christmas. Fortunately he'd outfoxed her and made the sale. By rights, he should be celebrating, but he experienced little satisfaction and no sense of triumph.<br><br>Ruth had been expecting him to make a fuss, demand that the assignment go to one of the junior sales reps. Matt had merely smiled and reached for the plane tickets. He'd sold the software, but was left feeling that although he'd won the battle, he was destined to lose the war.<br><br>And a whole lot more.<br><br>Pam, his wife of fifteen years, hadn't been the least bit understanding about this trip. If ever he'd needed her support it was now, but all she'd done was add to his burden. "Christmas, Matt? You're leaving three days before Christmas?"<br><br>What irritated him most was her complete and total lack of appreciation for his feelings. It wasn't like he'd <em>asked </em>for this trip or wanted to be away from the family. The fact that Pam had chosen the evening of his departure to start an argument revealed how little she recognized the stress he'd been under since the promotions were announced.<br><br></p><h2>Matthew, Vol.1 (Ch. 1-12), The Expositor&#39;s Bible Commentary</h2><p><p>The award-winning Expositor's Bible Commentary, now available in this handy softcover edition, has established itself as one of the leading and most practical evangelical commentaries.

This time, he must break into a Prague prison to liberate a despicable Nazi who will lead Tanner to the documents exposing his network of hatred. As is typical in Block's Tanner yarns, the spy has unusual allies: a gang of Israeli terrorists and a beautiful Czech nymphomaniac. Then Tanner and his charge, Janos Kotacek, make a painstaking journey through Hungary and Yugoslavia and finally to Portugal. The means he devises to silence Kotacek's racist rants, sneak him into the West, and trick him into revealing his secrets are extremely clever. Nick Sullivan's skill with a wide range of accents and his irreverent tone make him the perfect reader for Tanner's Cold War adventures.

Even as Benteen ran that unpleasant thought around the inside of his head, his implant sent a chime through his thoughts. Message? From whom?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fear returned in an instant, tensing his nerves, pumping through his veins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Benteen flicked on the photonic com that channeled through his implant. The image projected before his eyes was a news shot: Artollia Shayne as she was paraded into a Corporate board of inquiry at the Hall of Justice, her hands cuffed behind her. Artollia was accompanied by a phalanx of lawyers. Not that it would do her any good. Chairman Radcek and his henchmen would orchestrate the entire proceeding. The depth of Artollia's machinations had been discovered; she'd been flanked, ambushed at the last moment, and set up for the fall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Corporate politics wasn't a game for the timid. Those who lost considered themselves lucky if their only censure turned out to be exile or incarceration. Benteen suspected that Artollia-having come as close as she had to unseating Radcek-would pay with her life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Tamarland? Hope you're getting this," Artollia's head counsel's voice accompanied the images of the courtroom. "Whatever you do, under no circumstances should you return to Solar System. I'm sending a short-burst photonic encryption, starting now."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A red dot flashed in his holo, indicating that the compressed photonic code had been received by his implant and placed in memory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The red dot flashed off. The image faded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Benteen tilted his head back into the astrogation chair's cushion and closed his eyes. She'd already risked more for him than she should have. Had somehow wrangled at the last instant to assign him to Vixen when she could have used his life as a bargaining chip. That bit of loyalty had been above and beyond call despite the intimate aspects of their relationship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"She knew they were onto us," Benteen whispered as the countdown continued.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The miracle was that he'd made it this far. And, in only minutes now, he might make it all the way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Escape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the last couple of days it had seemed impossible. Yet here he was.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had been too good to be true when a reservation under a false identity placed him on an express flight to Neptune where Corporate marines had met him at the shuttle hatch and escorted him to Vixen's airlock.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By the time he'd been directed to his quarters aboard the exploration ship, word had broken of Artollia's arrest on charges of corruption, sedition, extortion, and murder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By removing him, facilitating his escape, she'd ensured that no one could interrogate Tamarland Benteen about his actions on her behalf. All that blood, all that murder and death. He might have been Artollia Shayne's most potent weapon, but with Callypso Radcek's victory, Tam Benteen would now become Solar System's most hunted and feared criminal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tam had no trouble imagining that familiar and mocking smile as it curled Artollia's delicate lips.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, you won again, didn't you, my love?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Vixen, do we have a go?" Torgussen asked the ship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"All systems are go," the ship's AI replied in its reasonable voice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Benteen glanced around the astrogation center with its controls, workstations, and the holos displaying endless data. Once this would have been called the bridge. Now it accommodated Captain Torgussen, Engineer Wang Chung Ho, and First Officer Seesil Vacquillas. Each sat at his or her station, eyes fixed on the scrolling data and tuned into their implants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Second Officer Valencia Seguro was down below, monitoring the ship's physical plant where water, hydroponics, and atmosphere were located. The scientific and survey team should be another two decks down, watching in the lounge monitors that gave them the last glimpse of Neptune and the distant sun as Vixen's reactors began spinning energy fields around the globular ship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the next two years Vixen would be Tamarland Benteen's home, his entire universe. At the other end of the monotony, processed food, and claustrophobia, lay Capella III-commonly called Donovan's planet for the man who'd died there. Vixen's mission consisted of comprehensive mapping, survey, analysis, and sample collection before initiating the two-year voyage home. Her scientific team was to determine if the planet's resources justified the cost of exploitation, and, critically, if human habitation was even possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Figure, all in all, that Tam had maybe five years before he had to face Corporate justice-assuming they even still cared by that time. Surely Radcek couldn't stay in power that long.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The external monitors showed space wavering and distorting around Vixen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ten seconds," Vacquillas called. ". . . Five, four, three, two, one."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the monitors the black-and-star-frosted fabric of space turned pearlescent gray. Shiny, flowing and translucent. Then blank.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Inversion," Torgussen called. "Status?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Reaction stable," Vacquillas told him. "Inversion complete."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Good work, people," Torgussen said softly. "Looks like we made it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I win! I made it! Tam wanted to shout out loud. Raise a defiant fist and bellow, Fuck you, Radcek!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like the professional he was, he let none of it show, but shifted in his chair, calmly asking, "Is that all there is to it? I thought I'd feel something. A sense of difference. I mean, we're outside of the universe, right? Like we just vanished from space."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Advisor Benteen," Vacquillas told him, "we might be outside of our universe, but we're carrying our own little bubble of it locked inside the field generation with us. Sorry, but it's kind of anticlimactic."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He forced himself to take a breath. Back in Solar System they'd be pulling Artollia's organization apart, searching out every one of her operatives, clients, and benefactors. Radcek was ruthless when it came to the destruction of his . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What the hell!" Torgussen straightened in his chair as the monitors flickered, shimmered, and flashed with the image of stars against velvet black.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't get it," Vacquillas muttered under her breath. "The reactors just shut down, reverting symmetry. All systems are reporting normal, just as if we'd completed the entire two years in transit. Chronometer reads zero elapsed time since inversion."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Neptune control, this is Vixen. Do you read?" Torgussen addressed the photonic com. The unit's entangled photonics allowed him real-time communications with the navigational station at Neptune control. He should have received an immediate response.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Neptune control, this is Vixen. Do you read?" Torgussen repeated. "We've got a malfunction, Neptune control. Inverted symmetry failed. Do you read?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Benteen leaned forward, curious about why there was no reply, wondering, immediately, if Corporate Security was behind the failure. That somehow, some way, he'd been fingered as Artollia's key agent. The man she lovingly called her scorpion. Perhaps Neptune control was under orders not to reply as a marine patrol cutter closed to effect his arrest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A sinking sensation in the gut brought a weary smile to his lips. Well, shit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It always came with risk," he told himself softly, waiting to hear the Corporate hail for the Vixen to stand to and be boarded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Vixen, do we have a malfunction?" Torgussen demanded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Negative, Captain," Vixen's voice assured. "Analysis of all systems indicates a successful inversion of symmetry. Mathematical algorithms analysis indicates that all statistical probabilities have been met." A pause. "In short, sir. Analytics indicate that we're right where we're supposed to be."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Torgussen looked puzzled. The journey to Capella took a little over two years as the mathematical and statistical equations ran in the qubit computers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tam Benteen sure as hell didn't have a clue about how that worked. More black magic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And then he really got a good look at the monitors that showed the star field, the swirls, splotches, and patterns of frost-like light that smeared the midnight background. Nothing looked familiar. He couldn't quite place the patch of near total black that looked like a hole in the stars. Certainly not the Coal Sack. Nor did the Milky Way, brighter, more misshapen, seem quite right. He struggled-having often oriented himself by the heavens-to find the first fricking familiar thing in this new immensity. No Big Dipper, no Orion, no Southern Cross. He stared at an entirely new starscape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"This is nucking futs," Vacquillas growled as she flipped data bits back and forth where her hands interacted with the holo display and her implants. "We should have red lights all over the board. Everything's reading optimal. No abort to the field generation, no fluctuations in the reactors. Nothing."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm getting the same thing," Ho added from his station. "Nothing's offline. The only weird reading is an eighty-eight-percent fuel consumption."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Eighty-eight percent?" Torgussen swiveled in his chair. "That's impossible. It would have taken years to consume eighty-eight percent. Gauge malfunction?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"My board diagnostics don't indicate a malfunction," Ho insisted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Okay, so we inverted, it failed, and we popped back into Solar System," Torgussen insisted. "What went wrong?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You tell me." Ho growled. "Maybe Neptune control telemetry can give us a clue. They would have been watching right up to the last second."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Torgussen tried again to raise Neptune control on the photonic com, heard only silence in return. "They're still not answering. Seesil, get an astral fix. Maybe we popped a couple thousand klicks from our original position."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally. This would solve his mystery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vacquillas did, flicking her fingers to bring up the star charts for Solar System. Then she ordered: "Superimpose Vixen's position and locate."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The stars wavered, seemed to expand and then shrink as the ship's external sensors projected their observations against that of Solar System.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No match," Vixen's voice informed. "Checking star charts now." A pause. "Location established. Capella system. Six point one five light-hours from the primary. Twenty-one degrees, seven minutes, thirty-two seconds inclination."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Impossible!" Torgussen cried, standing from his chair to stare as Vixen superimposed the star charts with the masters recorded during Tempest's initial survey of the Capella system more than a decade ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"This has got to be wrong," Ho snapped. "We barely inverted symmetry."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Running additional analytics now," the ship told them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I gotta go check this." Vacquillas stood, taking her holo with her. "I'm headed to the observation dome. I want to see with my own eyes."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yeah, go," Torgussen told her, gaze fixed on the rolling screens of data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't get it. What's the problem?" Tam asked. "So, we're there. So what?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So, Advisor, it doesn't work that way," Torgussen insisted. "After years of hypothesis testing, we're barely beginning to grasp the theoretical roots of navigation in inverted symmetry. Put in the simplest of terms, once a ship has inverted symmetry, its location is a matter of statistical probability. The longer the ship is outside, the more time it has to appear in any given place, or nowhere at all. But we know that if you run a series of mathematical equations and statistics, they somehow set the initial conditions for where the ship will or will not appear. Sort of like the way quantum mechanics function in our universe.

Because Henderson sings his own praises throughout, Andre Braugher presents most of the material with a touch of arrogance in his voice. Yet he conveys Henderson&#39;s feelings for his family and friends with compassion and is animated when expressing the frustration, excitement and humor of the game. M.P.T. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineHenderson, who holds baseball's major-league record for most stolen bases, won't steal into many hearts with this superficial and self-congratulatory autobiography co-written by a baseball writer for the Gannett News Service. When Henderson broke Lou Brock's base-stealing record last year, he promptly grabbed a microphone and crowed, ``I am the greatest of all time.'' The subsequent public backlash did nothing to temper his pride, although it clearly stung, judging by the flood of defensive self-promotion on view here. For example: ``I don't think I'm greedy. If number one means stolen bases, hits, and runs, it also means dollars. Number one in all categories. That's not being greedy. That's being deserving. That's being number one. That's America.'' Sad to say, there's little in Henderson's retelling of his life to compensate for all the grandstanding. While some memories grip (the 1982 theft of 130 bases, a childhood friendship with M.C. Hammer) and genuine feeling sometimes seeps through (above all, in Henderson's deep love for manager Billy Martin), by and large this is autobiography by the book. A young man proves himself, paeans to motherhood powder the page, and Henderson's ego constantly gets in the way: Do we really need to listen to him tell Mark McGwire how to hit home runs? Unquestionably, Henderson is a baseball genius, the greatest lead-off hitter and base-stealer ever. But his mouth moves as fast as his legs, and the reader is left holding the bag.

How could anybody write a debunking book about Mother Teresa and her Missionaries of Charity order? Well, in this little cruise missile of a book, Hitchens quickly establishes that the idea is not without point. After all, what is Mother Teresa doing hanging out with a dictator's wife in Haiti and accepting over a million dollars from Charles Keating? The most riveting material in the book is contained in two letters: one from Mother Teresa to Judge Lance Ito--then weighing what sentence to dole out to the convicted Keating--which cited all the work Keating has done "to help the poor," and another from a Los Angeles deputy D.A., Paul Turley, back to Mother Teresa that eloquently stated that rather than working to reduce Keating's sentence, she should return the money he gave her to its rightful owners, the defrauded bond-holders. (Significantly, Mother Teresa never replied.) And why do former missionary workers and visiting doctors consistently observe that the order's medical practices seem so inadequate, especially given all the money that comes in? (Hitchens acidly observes that on the other hand, Mother Teresa herself always manages to receive world-class medical care.) Hitchens's answer is that Mother Teresa is first and foremost interested not in providing medical treatment, but in furthering Catholic doctrine and--quite literally--becoming a saint.Christopher Hitchens (1949-2011) was a contributing editor to Vanity Fair and a regular contributor to the New York times Book Review and Slate.

As the victims fall, their lives unfold before our eyes in leisurely narratives: aspiring film ingenue Karin navigates the treacherous waters of Nazi showbiz; mother Helga attempts to save her retarded son from ruthless eugenics. There is a palling sameness to the manner in which each woman happens upon her doom loitering on the doorstep of her salvation, but the novel's emphasis is less on building tension than on a panoramic portrait of a nation seduced and raped by Hitler and his Reich. Most vivid is the depiction of postwar Berlin, especially as seen through the eyes of a German cop's teenage son, Ben, who negotiates the ravaged city in quest of a new suit of clothes with all the entrepreneurial flair of Tom Sawyer. Not a typical thriller, this may not appeal to all fans of Alan Furst and J.

He has written over thirty novels under his own name and more than twenty bestselling historical novels featuring Richard Bolitho under the pseudonym Alexander Kent.Chapter 1 A Time for Parting <p>The tall window of the Golden Lion Inn which faced south across Plymouth Sound shivered violently in its frame as another freak gust speckled the glass with drizzle and blown spray. </p><p>Captain Richard Bolitho had been standing with his back to a blazing log fire, his hands behind him, as he stared unseeingly at the bedroom carpet, and the sudden flurry of wind made him look up, his mind dragging with the mixed emotions of urgency and a new, alien sense of apprehension at leaving the land. </p><p>He crossed quickly to the window and stood looking down across the deserted roadway, the shining cobbles and the grey tossing water beyond. It was eight o'clock in the morning, but being the first day of November was still almost too dark to see much more than a blurred grey panorama through the dappled glass. He could hear voices beyond the bedroom door, the sounds of horses and wheels in the yard below, and knew that the moment of parting had almost arrived. He stooped over a long brass telescope which was mounted on a tripod by the window, no doubt for the benefit of inn guests or the amusement of those who saw the passing ships-of-war as nothing more than things of beauty or momentary distraction. It was strange to realise that 1794 was drawing to a close, that England had been at war with Revolutionary France for nearly two years, and still there were many people who were either indifferent or totally unaware of their peril. Perhaps the news had been too good, he thought vaguely, and certainly this year had gone well at sea. Howe's conquest, the Glorious First of June as it was now called, Jarvis's capture of the French West Indian islands, and even the taking of Corsica in the Mediterranean should have meant that the way was already opening up for total victory. But Bolitho knew better than to accept such ready judgements. The war was spreading in every direction, so that it seemed as if it would eventually engulf the whole world. And England, in spite of her ships, was being forced back further and further upon her own resources. </p><p>He eased the telescope carefully to one side, seeing the serried whitecaps cruising across the Sound, the wedge of headland and the hurrying ranks of leaden clouds. The wind was freshening from the north-west and there was a hint of snow in the air. </p><p>He held his breath and steadied the glass on a solitary ship which lay far out, seemingly motionless and making the only patch of colour against the bleak sea. </p><p>The Hyperion, his ship, was waiting for him. It was hard, no impossible, to picture her as the battered, shot-scarred two-decker he had brought to Plymouth six months earlier after her desperate fight in the Mediterranean following Hood's failure to hold and occupy Toulon. Six months of pleading and bribing, of bullying dockyard workers and watching over every phase of the old ship's repairs and refit. And she was old. </p><p>Twenty-two years had passed since her good Kentish oak had first tasted salt water, and almost all the time she had been in continuous commission. From the freezing misery of the Atlantic to maddening calms in the Indies. From the broadsides of the Mediterranean to patient blockade duty off one enemy port or another. </p><p>When she had been docked Bolitho had seen weed nearly six feet long scraped from her fat bilges. No wonder she had been so slow. Now, outwardly at least, she looked a new ship. </p><p>He watched the strange silvery light play across her tall side as she swung heavily at her anchor. Even at this distance he could see the taut black tracery of her rigging and shrouds, the double line of gun-ports, the small scarlet rectangle made by her ensign as it stood out in the freshening wind. </p><p>Once it had seemed as if the refit, the work and delays would never end. Then in the last few weeks she had returned to the waiting sea, her rigging had been set up, her seventy-four guns replaced, the deep-bellied hull filled with stores, provisions, powder and shot. And men. </p><p>Bolitho straightened his back. Six months was a long while to be away from her natural element. This time she would not be returning with the seasoned, well-disciplined company he had taken command of sixteen months ago, most of whom had been aboard for four years. In that time you could expect even the dullest landsman to find his place in things. But those men had been paid off. Not to a well-earned rest, but scattered to the demands of an ever-growing fleet, leaving him with only a few of the senior ones who were needed to deal with the ship's more intimate repairs. </p><p>For weeks his new company had been gathered from every available source. From other ships, the port admiral, and even the local Assizes. At his own expense, but with little hope, Bolitho had sent handbills and two recruiting parties in the search for new men, and had been astonished when some forty Cornishmen had arrived on board. Most were landsmen, from farms or the mines, but all were volunteers. </p><p>The lieutenant who had brought them aboard had been full of compliments and something like awe, for it was rare indeed to volunteer to leave the land for the harsh discipline and hazards of life in a King's ship. Bolitho could still not believe that these men actually wanted to serve with him, a fellow Cornishman, one whose name was well known and admired throughout their native county. He was completely baffled by it and not a little moved. </p><p>Now that was all in the past. Crammed within the one-hundred-and-eighty-foot hull his new company was waiting for him. The man who, next to God, would control their lives. Whose judgement and skill, whose bravery or otherwise would decide whether they lived or died. Hyperion was still some fifty short of her six hundred complement, but that was little enough in these hard times. Her real weakness lay in the immediate future, the days when he would have to drive every man in order to weld them all into one trained community. </p><p>He came out of his brooding thoughts as the door opened, and when he turned he saw his wife framed in the entrance. She was dressed in a long green velvet cloak, the hood thrown back from her rich chestnut hair, and her eyes were very bright, so that he suspected the tears were only just held in check. </p><p>He crossed the room and took her hands. It was still difficult to understand the good fortune which had made her his wife. She was beautiful and ten years younger than he, and as he looked down at her he knew that leaving her now was the hardest thing he had ever done. Bolitho was thirty-seven years old, and had been at sea from the age of twelve. During that time, as he survived both hardship and danger, he had often felt something akin to contempt for the men who preferred to stay in the safety of their homes rather than sail in a King's ship. He had been married to Cheney for five months, and now he understood just how agonising such partings could be. </p><p>During the long refit she had never been far from his side. It had been a new and devastatingly happy time, in spite of the ship's needs and the daily work which took him to the dockyard. Mostly he had spent his nights ashore with her in the inn, and sometimes they had gone for long walks above the sea, or had taken a pair of horses as far as Dartmoor. That was until she had told him she was going to have his child, when she had laughed at his immediate concern and protective uncertainty. </p><p>He said, "Your hands are like ice, my dear." </p><p>She smiled. "I have been down in the yard telling Allday how to unpack some of the things I have prepared for you." Again the tilt of the chin, the slight quiver in her lip. "Remember, Richard, you are married now. I'll not have my captain as thin as a rake for want of good food." </p><p>From the stairway Bolitho heard Allday's discreet cough. At least he would be with him. His coxswain, the man who next to his old friend Herrick probably knew him better than anyone. </p><p>He said quickly, "Now you will take care, Cheney?" He squeezed her hands tightly. "When you get back to Falmouth there will be plenty of friends if you need anything." </p><p>She nodded, then reached out and touched his white-lapelled coat and rested her fingers on his sword hilt. "I will be waiting for you, my dear Richard." She dropped her eyes. "And if you are at sea when our child is born you will still be with me." </p><p>Allday's stocky figure rounded the side of the door. </p><p>"The barge is waiting, Captain. I've stowed all the gear as ma'am ordered." He looked at her admiringly. "And never fret, ma'am, I'll take good care of him." </p><p>She gripped Bolitho's arm fiercely and whispered, "See that you do. And pray God will keep both of you safe!" </p><p>Bolitho prised her fingers away and kissed her gently. He felt wretched and wished he had words to make the parting easier. At the same time he knew that there were no such words, nor ever had been. </p><p>He picked up his gold-laced hat and tugged it down across his forehead. Then he held her in his gaze for a few more seconds, feeling their pain, understanding their loss, and then without another word turned and strode to the stairs. </p><p>The landlord bowed as he crossed to the main doors, his round face solemn as he intoned, "Good luck, Cap'n! Kill a few o' they Frogs for us'n!" Bolitho nodded curtly and allowed Allday to wrap the thick boat-cloak around his shoulders. The landlord's words were meaningless, he thought. He probably said exactly the same to the endless procession of captains and sea officers who stayed briefly beneath his roof before returning to their ships, some for the last time. </p><p>He caught sight of himself in a wall mirror beside the ostler's bell and saw that he was frowning. But what a difference the past six months had made. The realisation made him stare at himself for several moments. The deep lines around his mouth had faded, and his tall figure looked more relaxed than he could remember. His black hair was without a trace of grey, in spite of the fever which had nearly killed him between the wars, and the one lock which still curled rebelliously above his right eye made him look younger than his years. He saw Allday watching him and forced a smile. </p><p>Allday threw open the doors and touched his hat. "It seems like a long while since we were to sea, Captain." He grinned. "I'll not be sorry to leave. The Plymouth wenches are not what they were." </p><p>Bolitho walked past him and felt the rain across his face like ice rime. He quickened his pace with Allday striding comfortably behind him. The ship was lying a good two miles offshore, both to take advantage of the wind and tide and to deter any would-be deserter. The barge crew would have a hard pull to reach her. </p><p>He paused above the jetty stairs feeling the wind swirling around him, the land beneath his feet, and knowing as he always did that he might never set foot ashore again. Or worse, he might return as some helpless cripple, armless or eyeless, like so many who thronged the waterfront taverns as reminders of the war which was always present, even if unseen. </p><p>He turned to look back at the inn and imagined he could see her in the window. </p><p>Then he said, "Very well, Allday, call the barge alongside." </p><p>Once clear of the jetty wall the oars seemed to make the boat skim across the low cruising whitecaps, and as Bolitho sat huddled in his cloak he wished that he had a whole ship's company like these bargemen. For they were his original barge crew, and in their white trousers and check shirts, with their pigtails and tanned faces they looked every inch the landsman's idea of British sailors. </p><p>The barge's motion became heavier as it plunged clear of the shore, and Bolitho settled down to watch his ship as she grew slowly out of the haze of spray and drizzle until the towering masts and yards and the neatly furled sails seemed to fill the horizon. It was a normal illusion but one which never failed to impress him. Once, when a mere child, he had gone to join his first ship, of similar size to Hyperion, but in those tender years she had seemed even larger and more than a little frightening. As this ship must now seem to the newly gathered men, he thought, both the volunteers and those pressed from safer lives ashore. </p><p>Allday swung the tiller and guided the barge past the high bows so that the gilt figurehead of Hyperion the Sun God seemed to reach with his trident right above their heads. </p><p>Bolitho could hear the twitter of pipes carried on the wind, and saw the scarlet-coated marines already mustered by the entry port, the blue and white of the officers and the anonymous press of figures beyond. </p><p>He wondered what Inch, his first lieutenant, would be thinking about this moment of departure. He wondered, too, what had made him retain the young lieutenant when plenty of senior ones had been ready to take such a coveted appointment. Next in line to a ship's captain there was always the chance, even the hope that promotion would come by that captain's sudden death or advancement to flag rank. </p><p>When he had taken command of the old seventy-four Bolitho had found Inch as the fifth and junior lieutenant. Service away from the land and often far from the fleet had guided the young officer's feet up the ladder of promotion as one officer after the other had died. When the first lieutenant had taken his own life Bolitho's friend Thomas Herrick had been on hand to take over, but now even he had left the ship with a captain's rank and a ship of his own. And so, Lieutenant Francis Inch, gangling, horse-faced and ever-eager, had got his chance. For some reason, not really understood by Bolitho himself, he was being allowed to keep it. But the thought of taking the ship to sea as second-in-command for the very first time might make him view his new status with misgivings and no little anxiety. </p><p>"Boat ahoy?" The customary challenge floated down the ship's side. </p><p>Allday cupped his hand. "Hyperion!" </p><p>As the oars were tossed and the bowman hooked on to the chains, Bolitho slipped out of his cloak, and clutching his sword to his hip jumped quickly for the entry port. And he was not even breathless. He found time to marvel at what good food and regular exercise ashore could do for one so long cramped and adjusted to shipboard life. </p><p>As his head came above the coaming the pipes broke into a shrill twitter, and he saw the sharp jerk of muskets as the marine guard came to the present. </p><p>Inch was there, bobbing anxiously, his uniform soaked with rain so that Bolitho guessed he had not left the quarterdeck since first light. The din ceased and Inch said, "Welcome aboard, sir." </p><p>Bolitho smiled. "Thank you, Mr. Inch." He looked around at the watching men. "You have been busy." </p><p>Inch was peering at the barge and was about to call to its crew when Bolitho said quietly, "No, Mr. Inch, that is no longer your work." He saw Inch staring at him. "Leave it to your subordinates. If you trust them they will come to trust you." </p><p>He heard heavy footsteps on the damp planking and turned to see Gossett, the master, plodding to meet him. Thank God he at least had been aboard the ship for several years. </p><p>Gossett was huge and bulky like a barrel, with a pair of the brightest eyes Bolitho had ever seen, although t...</p></p><h2>Pok�mon Ranger: The Official Pok�mon Strategy Guide</h2><p><b>Protect the Pok�mon!</b><br><br>� A full walkthrough of all the missions.<br>� Complete information for catching all the Legendaries in the game!<br>� Detailed Pok�mon Browser to give you the stats on the Pok�mon you'll meet.<br>� Stylus techniques explained so you can catch 'em all!</p><p></p><h2>Foundr Version 1.0</h2><p>After spending 4 years interviewing some of the greatest entrepreneurial minds in the world.

The world of these stories is Portuguese-American, redolent of incense and spices, resonant with ritual and prayer, immersed in the California culture of freeway and commerce. Packed with lyrical prose and vivid detail, acclaimed writer Katherine Vaz conjures a captivating blend of Old World heritage and New World culture to explore the links between families, friends, strangers, and their world. <br>&nbsp;<br>From the threat of a serial killer as the background for a young girl&#x2019;s first brush with death to the fallout of a modern-day visitation from the Virgin Mary; from an AIDS-stricken squatter refusing to vacate an empty Lisbon home to a mother&#x2019;s yearlong struggle with the death of her synesthetic daughter, these deft stories make their world ours.</p><p>Katherine Vaz is a Briggs-Copeland Fellow in fiction at Harvard University. She is the author of <i>Saudade</i>, a Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers selection; <i>Mariana</i>, available in six languages and selected by the Library of Congress as one of the Top 30 International Books of 1998; and <i>Fado &amp; Other Stories</i>, winner of the 1997 Drue Heinz Literature Prize."Katherine Vaz is the sort of fiction writer who makes me wonder why the rest of us even bother. . . .

Several stories rely on a unifying theme, such as dealing with fear or coping with loss. But instead of being structured on an arc of conflict, climax and resolution, these cerebral pieces demand that readers assemble the pictures for themselves."&#x2014;SFGate.com (<i>SFGate.com</i> 2008-10-12)<br><br>"One comes away from these stories believing that it is possible to bargain with, sacrifice to, confront, divert, and even overcome adversity.

Some are of natural origin&#x2015;summits, rivers and lakes, caves, or forest sanctuaries. Others are consecrated by religious practice&#x2015;shrines, temples, monasteries, or burial grounds. The holy sites of the Himalaya unite faith and geography to produce some of the most sublime places on Earth.<br><br>In <i>Land of Pure Vision</i>, David Zurick draws from his thirty-five years of experience as a geographer, photographer, and explorer of the Himalaya, combining scholarship and art to capture divine landscapes undergoing profound change. The stunning photographs featured in this volume cover the full geographical reach of the region, from the high plateaus of the western Himalaya to the rugged gorges of Tibet's eastern borderlands, from the icy summits of the north to the subtropical southern foothills. Some sites exist in isolation, with intact natural environments and cultural monuments. Others display the tension between the ancient, sacred character of a place and the indifferent course of the modern world.<br><br><i>Land of Pure Vision</i> explores how the religious practices of Tibetan Buddhism, Hinduism, and shamanism interweave holy sites into a cohesive landscape of transcendent beauty and inspiration. It portrays a world of mystery, magic, and beauty, where the human spirit is in synchronicity with natural forces. Beyond elegy, this beautifully illustrated book is a visual ethnography of people and place.</p><p><b>David Zurick</b>&nbsp;is the author of several books, including <i>Himalaya: Encounters with the Roof of the World</i> and <i>Illustrated Atlas of the Himalaya</i>."These pictures shimmer in otherworldly light - evocative, alive, luminous, and masterful. &nbsp;David Zurick makes the sacred come alive." &nbsp;-- Jonathan Mirsky, High Peaks Pure Earth<br><br>"LAND OF PURE VISION is a jewel; reflecting as it should be the spirit and sacredness of the Mountain; illustrating beautifully the mantra "OM MANI PADME HUM"." -- Roland and Sabrina Michaud, authors of Caravans to Tartary.</p><h2>Oceanic Art (World of Art)</h2><p>The dazzling colors and patterns of the art of the Pacific Islands have long entranced Western audiences, including artists such as Gauguin and Picasso. The tendency has been to regard Oceanic art as &#34;primitive,&#34; mysterious, shrouded in taboo, but Nicholas Thomas looks beyond the familiar, stunning surfaces of spears and shields, carved canoe prows and feather capes to discover the significance of art, past and present, for the people of the Pacific. He shows how each region is characterized by certain art forms and practices - among them Maori ancestral carvings, rituals of exchange and warfare in the Solomon Islands, the production of barkcloth by women in Polynesia - even as it is shaped by influences from within the Pacific and beyond. The dynamism and diversity of the art are reflected in the illustrations accompanying this revelatory text, from works that evoke the most deep-rooted customs to those that address contemporary political issues.</p><p></p><h2>Not For Parents Travel Book (Lonely Planet.

Pioneering and influential critique of art-historical method that has helped to shape the evolving discipline of art history</p><p>Sir Ernst Gombrich was one of the greatest and least conventional art historians of his age, achieving fame and distinction in three separate spheres: as a scholar, as a popularizer of art, and as a pioneer of the application of the psychology of perception to the study of art. His best-known book, The Story of Art - first published fifty years ago and now in its sixteenth edition - is one of the most influential books ever written about art. His books further include The Sense of Order (1979) and The Preference for the Primitive (2002), as well as a total of 11 volumes of collected essays and reviews. Gombrich was born in Vienna in 1909 and died in London in November 2001. He came to London in 1936 to work at the Warburg Institute, where he eventually became Director from 1959 until his retirement in 1976. He won numerous international honours, including a knighthood, the Order of Merit and the Goethe, Hegel and Erasmus prizes. Gifted with a powerful mind and prodigious memory, he was also an outstanding communicator, with a clear and forceful prose style. His works are models of good art-historical writing, and reflect his humanism and his deep and abiding concern with the standards and values of our cultural heritage.Published in 1967, 1972, and 1977, respectively, these heavily illustrated volumes offer a detailed analysis of Renaissance art by noted art historian Gombrich. The volumes received praise from critics, such as LJ's, who dubbed them an "important scholarly contribution to the understanding of the period" <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>More Flanimals</h2><p>This is a new bestseller from the pen of Ricky Gervais.

She felt herself to be at a crossroads: &#x201c;I shall be miserable, or happy; a wordy sentimental creature, or a writer of such English as shall one day burn the pages.&#x201d;<br><br> Today her prose is still blazing; perhaps it burns brighter than ever. This is the story of how a determined young woman with a notebook became one of the greatest writers of all time. It is a story that sparkles with wit and friendship, language and love, wicked jokes and passionate appreciation of ordinary things.<br><br> In this illuminating new account, Alexandra Harris uses vivid flashes of detail to evoke Woolf&#x2019;s changing backgrounds and preoccupations. We move from the close-packed rhythms of a Victorian childhood to the experiments of Bloomsbury and Woolf&#x2019;s trial-and-error answers to the pressing question of how to live. We see her tackling challenging forms of writing, trying out different voices, following flights of fancy, and returning to earth. Above all, we see her making conscious decisions about what to do next.<br><br> The book considers each of the novels in context, gives due prominence to a range of Woolf&#x2019;s dazzlingly inventive essays, traces the contentious course of her &#x201c;afterlife,&#x201d; and shows why, seventy years after her death, Virginia Woolf continues to haunt and inspire us. 50 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Alexandra Harris is a cultural historian and writer.

A leading international trade and finance policy expert and the author of <i>The Bush Agenda,</i> Juhasz presents eye-opening truths about a potentially catastrophic global energy crisis that only promises to get much worse in the coming years&#x2014;and provides possible solutions for meaningful change. Terry Tamminen, former Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, calls <i>The Tyranny of Oil </i>&#x201c;a bold blueprint for ending the madness,&#x201d; and the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> tells us, &#x201c;a good first step toward true energy independence is to read this insightful book.&#x201d;<br><br></p><p><blockquote><p>Why are oil and gas prices so high? </p><p>Who's really controlling those prices?</p><p>How much oil is left? </p><p>How far will Big Oil go to get it?</p><p>And at what cost to the environment, human rights, the economy, worker safety, public health, and democracy?</p><p>The answers aren't what you think. They're much worse. But there's also plenty that we can do about it.</p></blockquote><p>As oil prices&#x2014;and public outrage&#x2014;skyrocket, Antonia Juhasz, a leading industry critic and expert on corporations and globalization, gives us the hardest-hitting expos� of the oil industry in decades. In <em>The Tyranny of Oil</em> she investigates the true state of the U.S. oil industry&#x2014;uncovering its virtually unparalleled global power, influence over our elected officials, and lack of regulatory oversight, as well as the truth behind $150-a-barrel oil, $4.50-a-gallon gasoline, and the highest profit in corporate history. Exposing an industry that thrives on secrecy, Juhasz shows how Big Oil manages to hide its business dealings from policy makers, legislators, and, most of all, consumers. She reveals exactly how Big Oil gets what it wants&#x2014;through money, influence, and lies. </p><p><em>The Tyranny of Oil</em> offers both a new take on problems and a new set of solutions as Juhasz puts forward an immediate call to action&#x2014;a formula for reining in the industry, its governmental lobbying power, environmental destruction, and violence while reducing global dependence on oil. Her thought-provoking answers to the most pressing energy questions speak directly to readers concerned about oil and gas prices, global warming, wars for oil, and America's place in the world. With the major players in the world's most powerful industry charged with collusion, price-gouging, anticompetitive behavior, and unabashed greed, Juhasz calls boldly for the breakup of Big Oil.</p><p>Drawing on considerable historical research, Juhasz explores the parallels between today's companies and Standard Oil, the most powerful corporation of the early twentieth century, whose stranglehold on the economy and government was broken only by the vision and persistence of activists and like-minded politicians. We are in a similar position today, she argues, with powerful opportunities available for ordinary Americans to come together, reclaim their voices, and shore up our nation's crumbling democratic foundation. </p><p>A tool for meaningful change that blends history, original investigative research and reporting, candid interviews with key insiders, and a unique focus on activism, <em>The Tyranny of Oil</em> is required reading for every concerned global citizen.</p><p>Antonia Juhasz is a leading oil industry, international trade, and finance policy expert. She is the author of <em>The Bush Agenda</em>.

Starting from this premise, Charles Newman ventures forth on an irreverent, wide-ranging discussion of the&nbsp;"Post-Modern" attitude in&nbsp;fiction, culture, and sensibility. Newman questions the "revolutionary" claims of avant-garde novelists and literary theorists, but he is no less critical of the arguments&nbsp;of neoconservatives, neorealists, and advocates of "moral&nbsp;fiction." Newman argues that neither of these groups has confronted the unprecedented break with tradition entailed by an economics and culture of inflation. A combination of&nbsp;cultural critique, literary criticism, economic forecast, and historical jeremiad, <i>The Post-Modern Aura </i>is finally a positive statement, celebrating "The Act of Fiction" and suggesting how the forces which have been devaluing it might be overcome.</p><p>"The best thing I've read on the state of American culture in a long time."<b>&nbsp;- Christopher Lasch</b>One of the United States's "best, and best-neglected" authors,&nbsp;<b>Charles Newman</b>&nbsp;(1938-2006) was an American novelist, critic and editor who taught at Northwestern (where he founded&nbsp;<i>TriQuarterly&nbsp;</i>magazine<i>)&nbsp;</i>and various other universities, and was the recipient of Fulbright, Guggenheim and Rockefeller grants, as well as the Morton Dawen Zabel award from the Academy of American Arts and Letters.</p><h2>Downsizing Your Body - How the Industrial Food Complex Breeds Fat Americans by Bill Sardi (2009) Paperback</h2><p>WHAT HAPPENED TO AMERICA?<p> We were slim, trim and fin in the 1950s and 60s, and bulging out of our clothes by the year 2000...</p><p> Americans didnt just spontaneously begin to overeat for no reason - food producers were to blame.

The second in a planned three volumes of Thompson&#x2019;s writings, this edition completes the great surveyor and fur trader&#x2019;s spirited autobiographical narrative. In the 1848 Travels, Thompson describes his most enduring historical legacy - the extension of the fur trade across the Continental Divide between 1807 and 1812. During these years he established several Nor&#x2019;wester trading posts, made contact with the tribal peoples of the Columbia Plateau, and tirelessly mapped the lands he traversed, all the time striving westward toward the Pacific. The tale culminates with Thompson&#x2019;s historic arrival at the mouth of the Columbia in July 1811. Like its companion Volume 1, this work presents an entirely new transcription by William Moreau of Thompson&#x2019;s manuscript, and is accompanied by an introductory essay placing the author in his historical and intellectual context. Extensive critical annotations, a biographical appendix, and historical and modern maps, make this the definitive collection of Thompson&#x2019;s works, and bring one of North America&#x2019;s most important travelers and surveyors to a new generation of readers.</p><p>CA&#34;While preceded by several other editions, Thompson&#39;s manuscripts have had to wait until Moreau&#39;s exhaustive and impeccable edition to appear in trappings worthy of their fascination and importance. The editor as well as the publishers of this superb tandem of volumes (with a third in preparation) have painstakingly produced a woefully overdue publishing milestone. Although written 166 years ago, Thompson&#39;s Travels is the Canadian book of the year.&#34; Canadian Literature</p><h2>Soul Flight: Astral Projection and the Magical Universe</h2><p><p><strong></strong> </p> <strong>Forget everything you thought you knew about astral projection and the astral realm.

Based on firsthand accounts from long-lost survivors who have emerged to tell about it, this stirring tale of the &#x201c;Alamo of the Pacific&#x201d; will reverberate for generations to come.<br><br>On December 8, 1941, just five hours after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Japanese planes attacked a remote U.S. outpost in the westernmost reaches of the Pacific. It was the beginning of an incredible sixteen-day fight for Wake Island, a tiny but strategically valuable dot in the ocean. Unprepared for the stunning assault, the small battalion was dangerously outnumbered and outgunned. But they compensated with a surplus of bravery and perseverance, waging an extraordinary battle against all odds.<br> <br>When it was over, a few hundred American Marines, sailors, and soldiers, along with a small army of heroic civilian laborers, had repulsed enemy forces several thousand strong&#x2013;&#x2013;but it was still not enough. Among the Marines was twenty-year-old PFC Wiley Sloman. By Christmas Day, he lay semiconscious in the sand, struck by enemy fire. Another day would pass before he was found&#x2014;stripped of his rifle and his uniform. Shocked to realize he hadn&#x2019;t awakened to victory, Sloman wondered: Had he been given up for dead&#x2014;and had the Marines simply given up?<br><br>In this riveting account, veteran journalist Bill Sloan re-creates this history-making battle, the crushing surrender, and the stories of the uncommonly gutsy men who fought it. From the civilians who served as gunmen, medics, and even preachers, to the daily grind of life on an isolated island&#x2014;literally at the ends of the earth&#x2014;to the agony of POW camps, here we meet our heroes and confront the enemy face-to-face, bayonet to bayonet.</p><p>&#x201c;A thoroughly researched, cleanly written blend of history, narrative, and professional insight that cannot help but move you.&#x201d;<br>--James Webb, author of <b>Fields of Fire</b> and <b>The Emperor&#x2019;s General</b><i><br><br></i>&#x201c;<b>Given Up for Dead</b> is the riveting account of a small garrison of Marines, sailors, and civilian workers who handed the Japanese their first defear of World War II in the Pacific.

In 1942, he convinced Winston Churchill to build an aircraft carrier out of reinforced ice.<br><br>Pyke escaped from a German WWI prison camp, devised an ingenious plan to help the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, and launched a private attempt to avert the outbreak of the Second World War by sending into Nazi Germany a group<br>of pollsters disguised as golfers.<br><br>And he may have been a Russian spy.<br><br>In 2009, long after Pyke's death, MI5 released a mass of material suggesting that Pyke was in fact a senior official in the Soviet Comintern. In 1951, papers relating to Pyke were found in the flat of Cambridge Spy&#x201d; Guy Burgess after his defection to Moscow. MI5 had watchers&#x201d; follow Pyke through the bombed-out streets of London, his letters were opened, and listening devices picked up clues to his real identity.

In <b>The Open Door</b> the visionary director and theorist offers a lucid, comprehensive exposition of the philosophy that underlies his work. <br><br>It is a philosophy of paradoxes: We come to the theatre to find life, but that life must be different from the life we find outside. Actors have to prepare painstakingly yet be willing to sacrifice the results of their preparation. The director&#x2019;s most reliable tool may be his capacity to be bored. Brook illustrates these principles with anecdotes that span his entire career and that demonstrate his familiarity with Shakespeare, Chekhov, and the indigenous theatres of India and Iran. The result is an unparalleled look at what happens both onstage and behind the scenes, fresh in its insights and elegant in its prose.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Peter Brook was born in London and received his M.A. at Oxford, where he founded the Oxford University Film Society. He has been a director of the Royal Shakespeare Company and currently heads the International Centre of Theatre Research, in Paris.<br><br>He has directed over fifty productions, among them <i>Love&#x2019;s Labour&#x2019;s Lost,</i> <i>The Tempest, </i>and <i>King Lear</i> in Stratford-upon-Avon; <i>Ring Around the Moon, Oedipus, A View from the Bridge,</i> and <i>Hamlet</i> in London; <i>The Visit, Marat/Sade, A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream, </i>and <i>The Tragedy of Carmen</i> in New York; <i>Seargeant Musgrave&#x2019;s Dance, The Conference of the Birds, Timon of Athens, The Mahabharata, The Cherry Orchard, </i>and <i>The Tempest. </i>Among the films he has directed are <i>Lord of the Flies, King Lear,</i> and <i>Meetings with Remarkable Men</i>. His operas include <i>The Marriage of Figaro </i>and <i>Boris Godunov </i>at Covent Garden, and <i>Faust</i> and <i>Eug?ne Onegin</i> at the Metropolitan Opera. His books include <i>The Empty Space </i>(1968) and <i>The Shifting Point</i> (1987).<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>One day, in an English university, while giving the lectures that were the basis for my book <b>The Empty Space</b>, I found myself up on a platform in front of a big black hole, and right at the back of that hole I vaguely distinguished some people sitting in the darkness. As I began to speak, I felt that everything I said was quite pointless. I became more and more depressed, for I couldn't find a natural way of getting through to them.<br><br>I saw them sitting like attentive pupils, waiting for words of wisdom with which to fill their schoolbooks, while I was cast in the role of a tutor, vested with the authority that goes with standing six feet above the listeners. Luckily I had the courage to stop and suggest that we look for another space. The organisers went off, searched throughout the university and finally came up with a small room which was too narrow and very uncomfortable but where we found it possible to have a natural and more intense relationship. Speaking in these new conditions, I at once felt that a new contact existed between the students and myself. From that point on, I was able to talk freely and the audience was liberated in the same way. The questions, like the answers, flowed much more smoothly. The strong lesson concerning space that I received that day became the basis of the experiments that we undertook many years later in Paris, in our International Centre of Theatre Research.<br><br>In order for something of quality to take place, an empty space needs to be created. An empty space makes it possible for a new phenomenon to come to life, for anything that touches on content, meaning, expression, language and music can exist only if the experience is fresh and new. However, no fresh and new experience is possible if there isn't a pure, virgin space ready to receive it.<br><br>� <br><br>A remarkably dynamic South African director who created a Black Theatre movement in the South African townships said to me, "We have all read <i>The Empty Space</i>, it has helped us a lot." I was pleased but very surprised, as most of the book was written before our experiences in Africa and stant reference to the theatres of London, of Paris, New York . . . What could they have found of use in its text? How could they feel that the book was also for them? How could it link with the task of bringing theatre into the conditions of life in Soweto? I asked this question and he answered, "The first sentence!"<br><br><i>I can take any empty space and call it a bare stage.</i><br><i>A man walks across this empty space whilst someone</i><br><i>else is watching him, and this is all I need for an</i><br><i>act of theatre to be engaged.</i><br><br>They had been convinced that doing theatre under their conditions was an unavoidable disaster because in the townships of South Africa there isn't a single "theatre building". They had the feeling they could not get very far if they didn't possess thousand-seat theatres, with curtains and flies, lights and coloured projectors, like in Paris, London and New York. Then suddenly along came a book the first sentence of which affirmed that they had all they needed for doing theatre.<br><br>In the early seventies we began doing experiments outside of what was regarded as "theatres". For the first three years we played hundreds of times in streets, in cafes, in hospitals, in the ancient ruins of Persepolis, in African villages, in American garages, in barracks, between concrete benches in urban parks . . . We learned a lot, and the major experience for the actors was playing to an audience they could see, as opposed to the invisible audience to which they were accustomed. Many of them had worked in large, conventional theatres, and it was a profound shock to find themselves in Africa in direct contact with the audience, the only floodlight being the sun, which united spectator and performer in the same impartial glare. Bruce Myers, one of our actors, once said: "I've spent ten years of my life in the professional theatre without ever seeing the people for whom I'm doing this work. Suddenly I can see them. A year ago, I would have been panicked by the feeling of nakedness. The most important of my defences was being taken away. I'd have thought, 'What a nightmare to see their faces!" Suddenly he realised that, on the contrary, seeing the spectators gave a new meaning to his work. Another aspect of the empty space is that the emptiness is shared: it's the same space for everyone who is present.<br><br>� <br><br>At the time I wrote<b> The Empty Space</b>, those who searched for a "Popular Theatre" believed that everything that was "for the people" automatically had vitality, as contrasted with something that didn't have vitality, which was called "Elite Theatre". At the same time, the "Elite" felt they were privileged participants in a serious intellectual adventure which contrasted strongly with the turgid and devitalised "Commercial Theatre". Meanwhile, those who were working on "Great Classic Texts" were convinced that "High Culture" injects into the veins of society a quality way beyond the low-grade adrenaline of a vulgar comedy. However, my experience over the years taught me that this is quite false and that a good space is one in which many varied energies converge and all those categories disappear.<br><br>Luckily, when I started working in the theatre I was totally ignorant of all classifications. The great advantage that England provided in those days was that there was no school, no master, no examples. The German theatre was totally ignored, Stanislavsky virtually unknown, Brecht just a name and Artaud not even that. There were no theories, so people doing theatre slid naturally from one genre to another. Great actors could go from performing Shakespeare to a farce or a musical comedy. The audience and the critics followed in all simplicity, without feeling that they--or "theatre art"--were being betrayed.<br><br>In the early fifties we presented <i>Hamlet</i> in Moscow with Paul Scofield, who had played major roles for over ten years or so and was known in England as one of the most brilliant and accomplished actors of his generation. This was in the old Stalinist Russia, completely isolated-- in fact, I think we were the first English company to perform there. It was quite an event and Scofield was treated like a pop star.<br><br>Back in England, we continued to work together for a while, doing a play by Eliot, another by Graham Greene. One day, after our season had ended, he was offered the part of a cockney impresario in a musical comedy, the first of the pre-rock musicals. Paul was very excited: "It's wonderful. Instead of another Shakespeare play, I can sing and dance. It's called <i>Expresso Bongo</i>!" I encouraged him to accept, and he was very pleased and the play was a success.<br><br>While the show was running, an official Russian delegation comprised of about twenty actors, actresses, directors and theatre managers suddenly arrived from Moscow. As we had been so well received over there, I went to welcome them at the airport. The first question they asked concerned Scofield: "What's he doing? Can we see him?" "Of course," I replied. We arranged tickets for them and they went to see the show.<br><br>The Russians, especially in that period, had learned that one can always get out of any theatrical embarrassment with the use of one word: <i>interesting</i>. So they watched the play, met with Scofield and exclaimed unconvincingly that they had been "most interested". A year later we received a copy of a book written about the trip by the leader of the delegation, a Shakespeare expert at Moscow University. In the book I found a bad photo of Scofield wearing his slanting trilby from <i>Expresso Bongo</i>, with the following caption: "We were all saddened by the tragedy of the situation of the actor in a capitalist country. What humiliation for one of the greatest actors of our time to be forced to perform in something called<i> Expresso Bongo</i> in order to feed his wife and two children!"<br><br>I'm telling this story to share with you a fundamental idea: that theatre has no categories, it is about life. This is the only starting point, and there is nothing else truly fundamental. Theatre is life.<br><br>At the same time, one cannot say that there is no difference between life and theatre. In 1968 we saw people who, for very valid reasons, tired by so much "deadly theatre", insisted that "life is a theatre", thus there was no need for art, artifice, structures . . . "Theatre is being done everywhere, theatre surrounds us," they said. "Each of us is an actor, we can do anything in front of anyone, it's all theatre."<br><br>What is wrong with this statement? A simple exercise can make it very clear. Ask any volunteer to walk from one side of a space to another. Anyone can do this. The clumsiest idiot cannot fail, he just has to walk. He makes no effort and deserves no reward. Now ask him to try to imagine that he is holding a precious bowl in his hands and to walk carefully so as not to spill a drop of its contents. Here again anyone can accomplish the act of imagination that this requires and can move in a more or less convincing manner. Yet your volunteer has made a special effort, so perhaps he deserves thanks and a five-penny piece as a reward for trying. Next ask him to imagine that as he walks the bowl slips from his fingers and crashes to the ground, spilling its contents. Now he's in trouble. He tries to act and the worst kind of artificial, amateur acting will take over his body, making the expression on his face "acted"--in other words, woefully unreal. To execute this apparently simple action so that it will appear as natural as just walking demands all the skills of a highly professional artist--an idea has to be given flesh and blood and emotional reality: it must go beyond imitation, so that an invented life is also a parallel life, which...</p><h2>If Only They Could Talk</h2><p>When newly qualified vet James Herriot arrives in the small Yorkshire village of Darrowby, he has no idea what to expect.

Cixi led an intense and singular life. Chosen at the age of 12 to be a concubine by the Emperor Xianfeng, she gave birth to his only male heir who at four was designated Emperor when his father died in 1861. In a brilliant move, the young woman enlisted the help of the Emperor's widow and the two women orchestrated a coup that ousted the regents and made Cixi sole Regent. Untrained and untaught, the two studied history and politics together, ruling the huge nation from behind a curtain. When her boy died, Cixi designated a young nephew as Emperor, continuing her reign till her death in 1908. Chang gives us a complex, riveting portrait of Cixi through a reign as long as that of her fellow Empress, Victoria, whom she longed to meet: her ruthlessness in fighting off rivals; her curiosity to learn; her reliance on Westerners who she placed in key positions; and her sensitivity and desire to preserve the distinctiveness of China's past while overturning traditions (she, as Chang reveals--not Mao, as he claimed--banned footbinding) and exposing its culture to western ideas and technology.</p></p><p>JUNG CHANG was born in Sichuan Province, China, in 1952. She was a Red Guard briefly at the age of fourteen and then worked as a peasant, a &#34;barefoot doctor,&#34; a steelworker, and an electrician before becoming an English-language student and, later, an assistant lecturer at Sichuan University. She left China for Britain in 1978 and was subsequently awarded a scholarship by York University, where she obtained a PhD in linguistics in 1982, the first person from the People&#39;s Republic of China to receive a doctorate from a British university.Chapter One, Concubine to an Emperor (1835&#x2013;56)<br> &nbsp;<br> In spring 1852, in one of the periodic nationwide selections for imperial consorts, a sixteen-year-old girl caught the eye of the emperor and was chosen as a concubine. A Chinese emperor was entitled to one empress and as many concubines as he pleased. In the court registry she was entered simply as &#x2018;the woman of the Nala family&#x2019;, with no name of her own. Female names were deemed too insignificant to be recorded. In fewer than ten years, however, this girl, whose name may have been lost for ever,* had fought her way to become the ruler of China, and for decades &#x2013; until her death in 1908 &#x2013; would hold in her hands the fate of nearly one- third of the world&#x2019;s population. She was the Empress Dowager Cixi (also spelt Tzu Hsi). This was her honorific name and means &#x2018;kindly and joyous&#x2019;.<br> &nbsp;<br> She came from one of the oldest and most illustrious Manchu families. The Manchus were a people who originally lived in Manchuria, beyond the Great Wall to the northeast. In 1644, the Ming dynasty in China was overthrown by a peasant rebellion, and the last Ming emperor hanged himself from a tree in the back garden of his palace. The Manchus seized the opportunity to smash across the Great Wall. They defeated the peasant rebels, occupied the whole of China and set up a new dynasty called the Great Qing &#x2013; &#x2018;Great Purity&#x2019;. Taking over the Ming capital, Beijing, as their own, the victorious Manchus went on to build an empire three times the size of the Ming empire, at its peak occupying a territory of 13 million square kilometres &#x2013; compared to 9.6 million today.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Manchu conquerors, outnumbered by the indigenous Chinese, the Han, by approximately 100:1, imposed their domination initially by brutal means. They forced the Han males to wear the Manchu men&#x2019;s hairstyle as the most visible badge of submission. The Han men traditionally grew their hair long and put it up in a bun, but the Manchu men shaved off an outer ring of hairs, leaving the centre part to grow and plaiting it into a trailing queue. Anyone who refused to wear the queue was summarily beheaded. In the capital, the conquerors pushed the Han out of the Inner City, to the Outer City, and separated the two ethnic groups by walls and gates.* The repression lessened over the years, and the Han generally came to live a life no worse than that of the Manchus. The ethnic animosity diminished &#x2013; even though top jobs remained in the hands of the Manchus. Intermarriage was prohibited, which in a family-oriented society meant there was little social intercourse between the two groups. And yet the Manchus adopted much of the Han culture and political system, and their empire&#x2019;s administration, extending to all corners of the country like a colossal octopus, was overwhelmingly manned by Han officials, who were selected from the literati by the traditional Imperial Examinations that focused on Confucian classics. Indeed, Manchu emperors themselves were educated in the Confucian way, and some became greater Confucian scholars than the best of the Han. Thus the Manchus regarded themselves as Chinese, and referred to their empire as the &#x2018;Chinese&#x2019; empire, or &#x2018;China&#x2019;, as well as the &#x2018;Qing&#x2019;.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ruling family, the Aisin-Gioros, produced a succession of able and hard-working emperors, who were absolute monarchs and made all important decisions personally. There was not even a Prime Minister, but only an office of assistants, the Grand Council. The emperors would rise at the crack of dawn to read reports, hold meetings, receive officials and issue decrees. The reports from all over China were dealt with as soon as they arrived, and rarely was any business left undone for more than a few days. The seat of the throne was the Forbidden City. Perhaps the largest imperial palace complex in the world, this rectangular compound covered an area of 720,000 square metres, with a moat of proportional size. It was surrounded by a majestic wall some 10 metres high and nearly 9 metres thick at the base, with a magnificent gate set into each side, and a splendid watchtower above each corner. Almost all the buildings in the compound displayed glazed tiles in a shade of yellow reserved for the court. In sunshine, the sweeping roofs were a blaze of gold.<br> &nbsp;<br> A district west of the Forbidden City formed a hub for the transportation of coal, bound for the capital. Brought from the mines west of Beijing, it was carried by caravans of camels and mules, wearing tinkling bells. It was said that some 5,000 camels came into Beijing every day. The caravans paused here, and the porters did their shopping from stores whose names were embroidered on colourful banners or gilded on lacquered plaques. The streets were unpaved, and the soft, powdery dust that lay on top in dry weather would turn into a river of mud after a downpour. There was a pervasive reek from a sewage system that was as antiquated as the city itself. Refuse was simply dumped on the side of the roads, left to the scavenging dogs and birds. After their meals, large numbers of vultures and carrion crows would flock into the Forbidden City, perching on its golden roofs and blackening them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Away from the hubbub lay a network of quiet, narrow alleys known as hu-tong. This is where, on the tenth day of the tenth lunar month in 1835, the future Empress Dowager of China, Cixi, was born. The houses here were spacious, with neatly arranged courtyards, scrupulously tidy and clean, in sharp contrast to the dirty and chaotic streets. The main rooms had doors and windows open to the south to take in the sun, while the north was walled up to fend off the sandy storms that frequently swept the city. The roofs were covered with grey tiles. The colours of roof tiles were strictly stipulated: yellow for the royal palaces, green for the princes, and grey for all others.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cixi&#x2019;s family had been government employees for generations. Her father, Huizheng, worked as a secretary and then a section chief for the Ministry of Officials. The family was well-off; her childhood was carefree. As a Manchu, she was spared foot-binding, a Han practice that tortured their women for a millennium by crushing a baby girl&#x2019;s feet and wrapping them tightly to restrict their growth. Most other customs, such as male&#x2013;female segregation, the Manchus shared with the Han. As a girl of an educated family, Cixi learned to read and write a little Chinese, to draw, to play chess, to embroider and to make dresses &#x2013; all deemed desirable accomplishments for a young lady. She was a quick and energetic learner and developed a wide range of interests. In the future, when it was the ceremonial duty of the empress dowager, on a certain auspicious day, to cut the pattern for a dress of her own &#x2013; as a symbol of womanhood &#x2013; she would perform the task with tremendous competence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her education did not include learning the Manchu language, which she neither spoke nor wrote. (When she became the ruler of China, she had to issue an order for reports written in Manchu to be translated into Chinese before she was shown them.) Having been immersed in Chinese culture for 200 years, most Manchus did not speak their own original tongue, even though it was the official language of the dynasty and various emperors had made efforts to preserve it. Cixi&#x2019;s knowledge of written Chinese was rudimentary, and she may be considered &#x2018;semi- literate&#x2019;. This does not mean that she lacked intelligence. The Chinese language is extremely hard to learn. It is the only major linguistic system in the world that does not have an alphabet; and it is composed of numerous complicated characters &#x2013; ideograms &#x2013; which have to be memorised one by one and, moreover, are totally unrelated to sounds. At Cixi&#x2019;s time, written texts were completely divorced from the spoken form, so one could not simply write down what one spoke or thought. To qualify as &#x2018;educated&#x2019;, therefore, learners had to spend about a decade in their formative years imbibing Confucian classics, which were severely limited in range and stimulation. Fewer than 1 per cent of the population were able to read or write the bare minimum.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cixi&#x2019;s lack of formal education was more than made up for by her intuitive intelligence, which she liked to use from her earliest years. In 1843, when she was seven, the empire had just finished its first war with the West, the Opium War, which had been started by Britain in reaction to Beijing clamping down on the illegal opium trade conducted by British merchants. China was defeated and had to pay a hefty indemnity. Desperate for funds, Emperor Daoguang (father of Cixi&#x2019;s future husband) held back the traditional presents for his sons&#x2019; brides &#x2013; gold necklaces with corals and pearls &#x2013; and vetoed elaborate banquets for their weddings. New Year and birthday celebrations were scaled down, even cancelled, and minor royal concubines had to subsidise their reduced allowances by selling their embroidery on the market through eunuchs. The emperor himself even went on surprise raids of his concubines&#x2019; wardrobes, to check whether they were hiding extravagant clothes against his orders. As part of a determined drive to stamp out theft by officials, an investigation was conducted of the state coffer, which revealed that more than nine million taels of silver had gone missing. Furious, the emperor ordered all the senior keepers and inspectors of the silver reserve for the previous forty-four years to pay fines to make up the loss &#x2013; whether or not they were guilty. Cixi&#x2019;s great-grandfather had served as one of the keepers and his share of the fine amounted to 43,200 taels &#x2013; a colossal sum, next to which his official salary had been a pittance. As he had died a long time ago, his son, Cixi&#x2019;s grandfather, was obliged to pay half the sum, even though he worked in the Ministry of Punishments and had nothing to do with the state coffer. After three years of futile struggle to raise money, he only managed to hand over 1,800 taels, and an edict signed by the emperor confined him to prison, only to be released if and when his son, Cixi&#x2019;s father, delivered the balance.<br> &nbsp;<br> The life of the family was turned upside down. Cixi, then eleven years old, had to take in sewing jobs to earn extra money &#x2013; which she would remember all her life and would later talk about to her ladies-in-waiting in the court. As she was the eldest of two daughters and three sons, her father discussed the matter with her, and she rose to the occasion. Her ideas were carefully considered and practical: what possessions to sell, what valuables to pawn, whom to turn to for loans and how to approach them. Finally, the family raised 60 per cent of the sum, enough to get her grandfather out of prison. The young Cixi&#x2019;s contribution to solving the crisis became a family legend, and her father paid her the ultimate compliment: &#x2018;This daughter of mine is really more like a son!&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Treated like a son, Cixi was able to talk to her father about things that were normally closed areas for women. Inevitably their conversations touched on official business and state affairs, which helped form Cixi&#x2019;s lifelong interest. Being consulted and having her views acted on, she acquired self-confidence and never accepted the common assumption that women&#x2019;s brains were inferior to men&#x2019;s. The crisis also helped shape her future method of rule. Having tasted the bitter- ness of arbitrary punishment, she would make an effort to be fair to her officials.<br> &nbsp;<br> As he had raised a sizeable sum of money to pay the fine, Cixi&#x2019;s father, Huizheng, was rewarded in 1849 with an appointment from the emperor to be the governor of a large Mongolian region. That summer he travelled there with his family, setting up home in Hohhot, today&#x2019;s provincial capital of Inner Mongolia. For the first time Cixi journeyed out of crowded Beijing, beyond the decaying Great Wall and along a stony route that led to the Mongolian steppes, where uninterrupted open grassland extended to a very distant horizon. Throughout her life Cixi would feel passionate about fresh air and unrestricted space.<br> &nbsp;<br> In his new job as governor, Cixi&#x2019;s father was responsible for collecting taxes and, in line with prevailing and age-old practice, he fleeced the local population to make up for the family losses. That he should do so was taken for granted. Officials, who were paid low salaries, were expected to subsidise their income with whatever extras they could make &#x2013; &#x2018;within reason&#x2019; &#x2013; from the population at large. Cixi grew up with corruption of this kind as a way of life.<br> &nbsp;<br> In February 1850, months after the family settled in Mongolia, Emperor Daoguang died and was succeeded by his son, Emperor Xianfeng. The new emperor, then nineteen years old, had been born prematurely and had been in poor health since birth. He had a thin face and melancholy eyes, as well as a limp, the result of a fall from a horse in one of the hunting expeditions that were obligatory for the princes. As an emperor is referred to as a &#x2018;dragon&#x2019;, gossips in Beijing nicknamed him &#x2018;the Limping Dragon&#x2019;.<br> &nbsp;<br> After his coronation, an empire-wide operation began to select consorts for him. (At this point, he had one consort, a concubine.) The candidates, teenage girls, had to be Manchu or Mongol; the Han were excluded. Their families had to be above a certain rank, and had been obliged by law to register them when they reached puberty.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cixi was on the list and now, like other girls from all over China, she travelled to Beijing. She settled back into the family&#x2019;s old house and waited for the occasion when all the candidates would parade in front of the emperor. After he had made his pick, some of the girls would be given to the princes and other royal males as consorts. Those who failed to be chosen were free to go home and marry someone else. The inspection in the Forbidden City was scheduled for March 1852.<br> &nbsp;<br> The procedure for the inspection had been passed down over the generations. On the day before the fixed date, the candidates were taken to the palace in mule-drawn carts &#x2013; &#x2018;taxis&#x2019; of the day &#x2013; which were hired by their families and paid for by the court. These carts were like a trunk on two wheels, and were hooded with woven bamboo or rattan that had been soaked in tung-oil to become rain- and snow-proof. Curtains of bright blue were draped over it, and felt and cotton mattresses and cushions were piled inside. This was a common conveyance even for the families of princes, in which case the inside would be lined with fur or satin, depending on the season, while the outside bore markers of its owner&#x2019;s rank. On seeing such a vehicle passing by silently and disappearing into the gathering darkness, Somerset Maugham (later) mused:<br> &nbsp;<br> you wonder who it is that sits cross-legged within. Perhaps it is a scholar . . . bound on a visit to a friend with whom he will exchange elaborate compliments and discuss the golden age of Tang and Sung which can return no more; perhaps it is a singing girl in splendid silks and richly embroidered coat, with jade in her black hair, summoned to a party so that she may sing a little song and exchange elegant repartee with young blades cultured enough to appreciate wit.<br> &nbsp;<br> The cart that seemed to Maugham to be carrying &#x2018;all the ...</p><h2>The Independence Light Aircraft Carriers</h2><p>Naval aviation and aircraft carrier enthusiast and former intelligence officer Faltum details the light carriers that formed part of the fast carrier task forces of World War II.

Saint Irenaeus gave us the first <i>Against the Heresies</i> (<i>Adversus Haereses</i>) back in the second century. In the 20th, it is as of a second Irenaeus that we present these conferences by Archbishop Lefebvre under the same title. They both address the same problem: Man playing God. <br><br>Archbishop Lefebvre analyzes the various aspects of Liberalism in the same way Irenaeus did of Gnosticism. As Saint Irenaeus addressed the philosophical errors and presented the Catholic response, which is the rule of the Catholic Faith in the Creed, so Archbishop Lefebvre, too, shows how the modern errors in the Church and Society are so opposed to our unchanging Catholic Faith. The solution is the same. Catholic Tradition. The Deposit of Faith. The authority of the Holy See. <br><br>Both appeal to the one test of Truth, that is, "the teaching of the Church of Rome." In fact, Archbishop Lefebvre&#x2019;s defense is but a commentary on the encyclicals of the popes. They&#x2019;re dead, but their teaching shouldn&#x2019;t be.

Even though he does a good job of playing dumb muscle when he's hired out as a troll, when he isn't workin', he talks as good as anyone and better than most.</p><p>&#x201c;Ask Guido.&#x201d; Nunzio sez, jerkin' a thumb at me. &#x201c;It's his show.&#x201d;</p><p>Now Nunzio, in addition to bein' my cousin, is also my usual workin' partner of choice. Unfortunately, as sometimes happens even in the best of partnerships, we happen to be in disagreement as to the necessity of this meetin'. As the senior partner, I have pulled rank and the meetin' is happenin'. As junior partner, however, Nunzio is standing on his right to bein' a royal pain in the butt while assistin' me.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I sez, ignoring Nunzio, &#x201c;since we're all here, we might as well get started.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just a minute, Guido. Aren't we missing someone?&#x201d;</p><p>This is Aahz pipin' up from where he has been leanin' against the wall next to the door. Him, I've been expectin' trouble from.</p><p>I favor him with a level stare.</p><p>&#x201c;If youse is referrin' to the Boss, Aahz, I am well aware that he is not present. In fact, that is one of the reasons for this meetin'. You see, certain information has come to the attention of Nunzio and myself, and it is our . . . my desire to consult with all of youse as to whether it is wisest to pass said information along to the Boss, or if we should simply act on it ourselves.&#x201d;</p><p>This is, of course, the crux of the disagreement between Nunzio and myself, as, in the Mob, to hold a meetin' without the participation or even the knowledge of one's boss is to invite the interpretation that one is planning some kind of takeover attempt. In the Mob, such activity is justification for termination of the most permanent kind.</p><p>Now, knowin' the Boss the way we do, I do not fear that this is a likely possibility. Particularly as we are tryin' to figure out how to support him, not attemptin' any kind of power play. The truth of it is, we is quite fond of the Boss and have prospered individually since havin' been assigned to him.</p><p>Nunzio, on the other hand, maintains that the Boss is at least technically a Mob sub-chieftain, and that callin' this meetin' is therefore treadin' on even thinner ice than some of the capers we have taken part in since joinin' the Boss's crew. At least then, he sez, we could claim that we was actin' under orders from the Boss. This meetin' is definitely my own idea, and as such I will be held personally responsible for any fallout which might occur from it. There are times when bein' an order-takin' goon and therefore low on the chain of accountability has its advantages.</p><p>&#x201c;Let him talk, Aahz. I, for one, want to hear what he has to say.&#x201d;</p><p>That is Massha talkin', earnin' her one of my widest smiles for her support, which she returns with a wink.</p><p>Aahz starts to say somethin', then just shrugs and gestures for me to start.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I sez. &#x201c;Now you all know that durin' our recent assignment to stop or curtail the expansionist type efforts of Queen Hemlock, Nunzio and me stood duty for a while as Army types. Well, it seems that Hugh Badaxe's scouts have uncovered some news that affects the Boss. Not wantin' to take official action or use official channels, he looked up one of the squad that was servin' under Nunzio and me and sent `em here to pass the word along to us.&#x201d;</p><p>I turn and wave a hand at the figure lounging against the wall behind me.</p><p>&#x201c;This is Spyder. I guess you'd call her an old Army buddy of mine. Spyder, I'd like you to tell the crew what you told Nunzio and me.&#x201d;</p><p>Now Spyder was probably the toughest member of our squad after Nunzio and me. She is whipcord lean with the grace of an alley cat and twice the attitude. Due to Army regulations, her short hair is now a uniform light brown instead of the rainbow of colors it was when she enlisted. This has not, however, made her look any the more military or otherwise domesticated. She continues to give the impression of bein' an over-aged gutter punk ready to fight and half-lookin' for it, which is exactly what she is.</p><p>She has been studyin' the assemblage as they came in like a store security type durin' the holidays. As I feed her the cue, like, she cranks her cat-eyes around to look at me direct.</p><p>&#x201c;I don't think so,&#x201d; she sez, shakin' her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Spyder,&#x201d; I sez, tryin' to keep my voice level. &#x201c;This is not the time to get cute. I told you I wanted you to talk to these folks. Now tell them what Hugh Badaxe told you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You said you wanted me to talk to some friends of yours, Swatter,&#x201d; she snarls. &#x201c;And I agreed. Didn't even say `Boo' about us meeting in a stable. But who are these people? The big hairy guy with the different-sized eyes, and the two with the green scales and pointed ears? You can't tell me they're from around here. And unless I've gone completely around the bend, that is definitely a dragon listening in from that stall. I want to know whom I'm talking to before I open up. I know you and Nunzio, but these people . . . ?&#x201d;</p><p>She shakes her head again and lapses into a sullen silence.</p><p>&#x201c;What's with the `Swatter' bit, Guido?&#x201d; Massha asks.</p><p>&#x201c;It's an old Army nick-name,&#x201d; I sez wavin' her off. My attention is focused on my cousin. &#x201c;Nunzio, I thought you explained things to the squad back when we was hangin' together at Abdul's.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You said to explain about Abdul being a Deveel,&#x201d; he sez with a shrug. &#x201c;I told them that our work with the Boss had involved traveling to other worlds and dealing with strange creatures, and occasionally some of those creatures popped up here in our world. I also said that they could be tricky or nasty or both, and if any showed up, like Frumple, to let us handle them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That's it?&#x201d; I sez. &#x201c;You didn't tell `em anything about dimension or dimension travelers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At the time, that seemed more information than was necessary,&#x201d; he sez. &#x201c;They accepted it.&#x201d;</p><p>I am findin' this hard to believe, especially as Nunzio is usually one who loves to go on endlessly about anything at the drop of a straight line.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I sez. &#x201c;That was then and this is now. Perhaps you could elaborate a bit for Spyder's benefit, with particular attention to the players currently in the room.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; he sez, and turns to Spyder. &#x201c;You see, those worlds I mentioned before are actually called dimensions. There are thousands of them out there, and the beings that live in them do so, for the most part, without any knowledge or awareness of the other dimensions' existence . . . except, perhaps, for occasional legends or folk tales. A few, however, are not only aware of other dimensions, but often travel back and forth between them either as part of their work or simply adventuring. These dimension travelers are generally referred to as `demons' when they're in a dimension other than their own.&#x201d;</p><p>He paused and cocked his head at her, quizzical-like, but Spyder just keeps starin' at him.</p><p>&#x201c;Now the group assembled here,&#x201d; he continues, &#x201c;is known in some worlds as M.Y.T.H. Inc. We've joined together to provide services to individuals or groups who require assistance of an unusual nature or capacity. Our leader, or Chairman of the board, is the Boss . . . or, more commonly Skeeve. You know him or have heard of him as Skeeve the Great, currently serving as Royal Magician to the Court of Possiltum.</p><p>&#x201c;The green, scaly gent with the impressive teeth and the dour expression is Aahz. He was Skeeve's main instructor in magik and things dimensional, and is currently the boss's main advisor and second in command. He hails from the dimension Perv, which makes him a Pervect, as is his cousin, Pookie, the lean mean feminine version over there, who has recently joined our ranks to assist Guido and I with our bodyguarding duties.&#x201d;</p><p>Those two individuals incline their heads politely to Spyder, who nods back.</p><p>&#x201c;The large, hairy gentleman is Chumley. He and his sister Tananda, who is currently covering our home office, are from Trollia. As you might guess, he would be what you might have heard referred to as a Troll.&#x201d;</p><p>Chumley gives Spyder a deep bow. I notice with some approval how quickly Nunzio skips past the reference to Tananda. She and Spyder met briefly on our last assignment, but Tananda was disguised at the time so Spyder didn't spot her as a demon. The two of them didn't really get along, as they were both interested in the same man, so Nunzio is wise not to dwell on the subject.</p><p>&#x201c;Last, but certainly not least, is Massha. As you can see, it's hard to miss her, due both to her larger-than-life size and her propensity for bright outfits and jewelry. She and the Boss met on a caper in the dimension Jahk, and she was impressed enough to sign on as his apprentice. Within our crew, however, she's a full-fledged member.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hiya, Sugar!&#x201d; Massha sez, wigglin' her fingers at Spyder. &#x201c;Don't worry. We're not nearly as nasty as we look.&#x201d;</p><p>Spyder is so busy starin' at Massha she forgets to nod. This is not surprising, as Massha is quite an eyeful. Nunzio's statement that she is `larger than life' does not to begin to encompass her stature. Massha is huge, in all directions except up. What's more, her bright orange hair and green lipstick are upstaged by her loud, flashy clothes and enough jewelry to stock a small craft show.</p><p>&#x201c;The other member of our troupe is Bunny, who isn't with us at the moment because she's meeting with Skeeve to go over the kingdom's finances. Like Guido and me, she's from this dimension, which is known elsewhere as Klah, incidentally, so there's nothing unusual about her appearance other than she's cute as a button.&#x201d; He notices Spyder makin' a face at this, so he adds, &#x201c;It might also be worth noting that she is the niece of Don Bruce, the Fairy Godfather of the Mob locally. Speaking of which, you should also probably know that as far as Don Bruce is concerned, our whole operation is a part of the Mob. An independent, stand-alone part, but a part nonetheless.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gleep!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yes,&#x201d; Nunzio sez, pointin' to the contributin' party. &#x201c;The aforementioned dragon is Gleep. He is the Boss's pet and has assisted us on several capers, much to the dismay and demolition of our opponents. Does that satisfy your curiosity, Spyder?&#x201d;</p><p>He has not bothered to include either himself or me in the introductions, since, as was earlier noted, we have worked with Spyder before during our brief hitch in the Army. Of course, our own appearance is no less memorable than the rest of the team. We both have the size and build of professional athletes of the contact sport variety, only more intimidatin'. This was pretty much a prerequisite in our earlier work as Mob collection specialists.</p><p>&#x201c;I guess. At least, explains a few things,&#x201d; Spyder says comin' off the wall at last.</p><p>&#x201c;Then, returnin' to the point of this meetin',&#x201d; I sez, &#x201c;could you now tell everyone what Hugh Badaxe asked you to pass along?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you say so,&#x201d; she sez with a shrug. &#x201c;Basically, General Badaxe has been getting reports that pockets of malcontents are forming in the kingdom. Right now they're small and mostly talking, but he's concerned that they might eventually try taking action. Specifically, armed, organized action.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pardon me, my dear,&#x201d; sez Chumley, &#x201c;but I'm afraid I'm missing something here. Why is Hugh having you tell us about this? If there's a possible rebellion shaping up, why doesn't he simply handle it with the Army?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I'm getting to that.&#x201d; Spyder waves. &#x201c;You see, it's not the kingdom they're talking about overthrowing. It's the magician. The Great Skeeve. The Boss, as you call him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How's that again?&#x201d;</p><p>Aahz is no longer leanin' against the wall, but standin' tall and looking very attentive.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it seems the word going around the kingdom is that an evil magician, that's Skeeve, has the Queen in thrall and is actually running the kingdom from behind the scenes,&#x201d; Spyder explains. &#x201c;While most folks don't seem to care much one way or the other, there are those who are talking about trying to . . . how do they put it . . . </p><p>free the kingdom from his merciless grasp.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But that's patently absurd!&#x201d; Chumley sez with a frown. &#x201c;We all know Skeeve. He's got a good head on his shoulders and shows marked potential as a magician, but mostly he's an organizer. There isn't an evil bone in his body.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I'll tell you something else, Missy,&#x201d; Massha puts in. &#x201c;Skeeve is helping to bail out the kingdom at Queen Hemlock's personal request. She's the one who's trying to blackmail him into marrying her. How does that fit with your `magician holding the Queen in thrall' scenario?&#x201d;</p><p>For a second I am afraid that Spyder is going to go after Massha for the `Missy' comment, but she doesn't. This is a good thing, as Massha not only outweighs her on a factor of five or six to one, but also packs a mean magikal wallop in some of the jewelry she wears.</p><p>&#x201c;That's how you all see him,&#x201d; Spyder sez, &#x201c;and I'm inclined to believe you, mostly because I trust the Swatter and Nunzio. You've got to look at it through outsider's eyes to understand what's going on.</p><p>&#x201c;Skeeve definitely has the Queen's ear, that much you admit. Then there's the rumor that he consorts with strange, otherworldly creatures.&#x201d; She pauses and looks pointedly around the room. &#x201c;And some say he's guarded by a ferocious dragon.&#x201d; She nods toward Gleep, who cocks his head at her. &#x201c;And, finally, there's persistent talk that he has underworld connections and is supported by local organized crime.&#x201d;</p><p>She pointedly does not look at Nunzio and me, but the message gets across.</p><p>&#x201c;Not to offend the current company, but the citizens are thinking that `If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck . . .&#x201d;' She lets the sentence trail off. &#x201c;Anyway, whatever the truth is, that's what the talk is that's going around the kingdom. General Badaxe thought you should know.&#x201d;</p><p>I let the silence drag on for a few minutes as the team digests what they've heard.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Spyder,&#x201d; I sez at last. &#x201c;I guess the big question, and the reason I called this meetin', is: What are we going to do about all this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think you were right, Guido.&#x201d; Aahz sez. &#x201c;Both for calling the meeting and for thinking that it's best if Skeeve didn't hear about this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I'll have to second that,&#x201d; Chumley sez. &#x201c;The lad's never been particularly good at handling women, and this thing with Queen Hemlock has him tied up in knots. I say let's look into this ourselves and let Skeeve focus on his other problems.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; sez Aahz. &#x201c;Particularly since this might get a bit mess...</p></p><h2>Hinds&#39; Feet on High Places</h2><p><i>Hinds' Feet on High Places</i> is Hannah Hurnard's best-known and best-loved book, a beautiful allegory dramatizing the yearning of God's children to be led to new heights of love, joy, and victory.

Unlike his illustrations in Jonah Winter&#x2019;s Barack (2008), some of Ford&#x2019;s portraits here are overglamorized and sometimes awkward. It is Hopkinson&#x2019;s well-told story of Obama&#x2019;s life of hard work and brilliant success that will grab young people. The pages follow the future First Lady from her years as a gifted high-school student who studied on her long bus ride to her time at Princeton and Harvard Law School, her job in community service, and life as a devoted mother to her children. The Obamas&#x2019; romance is also covered: Michelle&#x2019;s first meeting with Barack in a Chicago law firm, their courtship, and their wedding.

At age five Sonia Rodriguez&#x2019;s stepfather began to abuse her; at 10 she was molested by her uncle and beaten by her mother when she told on him; and by 13 her home had become a hangout for the Latin Kings and Queens who were friends with her older sister. Threatened by rival gang members at school, Sonia turned away from her education and extracurricular activities in favor of a world of drugs and violence. The Latin Kings, one of the largest and most notorious street gangs in America, became her refuge, but its violence cost her friends, freedom, self-respect, and nearly her life. As a Latin Queen, she experienced the exhilarating highs and unbelievable lows of gang life. From being shot at by her own gang and kicked out at age 18 with an infant daughter to rejoining the gang and distinguishing herself as a leader, her legacy as Lady Q was cemented both for her willingness to commit violence and for her role as a drug mule. For the first time, a woman&#x2019;s perspective on gang life is presented.</p></p><p><b>Reymundo Sanchez</b> is the pseudonym of a former Latin King who no longer lives in Chicago.

Kulchyski&#39;s episodes balance brevity with constructive detail and, taken together, cover a great deal of history and territory. By detailing the points of continuity that link these stories from early &#34;contact&#34; to the present day, Kulchyski advances his central argument that the First Nations peoples are foundational to the Canadian state. -- Madelaine Jacobs, Canadian Literature</p><h2>Beyond Top Secret</h2><p>By the author of &#34;Above Top Secret&#34;, this book brings the story up to date with new evidence of unidentified flying objects, including confirmation from American and Russian military and scientific personnel that extraterrestrial craft do exist.

But what is she supposed to do with a nice, suburban Jersey boy in the form of a massive Grizzly shifter? Especially one with a rather unhealthy fetish for honey, moose, and. . .uh. . .well, <i>her</i>. Yet despite his menacing ursine growl and four-inch claws, Gwen finds Lachlan "Lock" MacRyrie cute and really sweet. He actually watches out for her, protects her, and unlike the rest of her out-of-control family manages not to morbidly embarrass her. Too bad cats don't believe in forever. <br><br>At nearly seven feet tall, Lock is used to people responding to him in two ways: screaming and running away. Gwen--half lioness, half tigress, all kick-ass--does neither. She's sexy beyond belief and smart as hell, but she's a born protector. Watching out for the family and friends closest to her but missing the fact that she's being stalked by a murderous enemy who doesn't like hybrids. . .and absolutely hates Gwen. Lock probably shouldn't get involved, but he will. Why? Because this is Gwen--and no matter what the hissing, roaring, drape destroying feline says about not being ready to settle down, Lock knows he can't simply walk away. Not when she's come to mean absolutely <i>everything</i> to him.</p><p><b>Shelly Laurenston</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>USA Today</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the&nbsp;Pride,&nbsp;Call of Crows, and The Honey Badger Chronicles, as well as winner of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>RT Book Reviews&nbsp;</i>Readers' Choice Award for her&nbsp;2016 novel,&nbsp;<i>The Undoing.&nbsp;</i>When she&#x2019;s not writing&nbsp;about sexy wolf, honey badger, lion, and other fang-filled predators, she's writing about sexy dragons as G.A.

Lock MacRyrie, a part-time grizzly bear, and Gwen O'Neill, a lion/tiger hybrid shifter, meet during a brawl. The fists never stop flying as they face down hate crimes, interfering relatives and the challenges of starting a furniture business. Despite being billed as a tough, streetwise Jersey girl, Gwen is a surprisingly and frustratingly passive heroine who has a hard time standing up to her dismissive family. In true cat fashion, she's plagued by jealousy yet leery of commitment, making her romance with Lock a struggle for both of them.

At sixteen he set out for Paris, intending to pursue a career as an engineer, but instead enlisted in Napoleon&#39;s Army. Stendhal took part in campaigns in Italy, Germany, Russia, and Austria, and then, after Napoleon&#39;s fall from power, settled in Milan, where he wrote books on art and music. Expelled from Italy for political reasons in 1821, he returned to Paris; following the 1830 revolution, he secured the position, which he was to hold for the rest of his life, of French Consul to Civitavecchia. Stendhal&#39;s great novels The Red and the Black (1830) and The Charterhouse of Parma (1839) were largely ignored during his lifetime, and many of his works remained unfinished and were published only posthumously. Among his most important books are On Love, Lucien Leuwen, The Memoirs of an Egotist, and The Life of Henry Brulard.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Cary Grant: A Touch of Elegance</h2><p>Reveals the tragedies and triumphs of Cary Grant&#39;s life, from his troubled boyhood in England to his superstardom in Hollywood and around the world</p><p>The author of Gable &amp; Lombard and The Other Marilyn here looks at the ineffable star who died while on tour in 1986. Harris repeats oft-published data on Grant, born Archibald Alexander Leach in England in 1904. There are accounts of his life as a poor child, early struggles in New York during the 1920s and later as a beginner in Hollywood. The inimitable actor rose to the top, starring in Topper, Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelphia Story and many other classic comedies and dramas, which Harris details. Also recorded are Grant's personal crises: four failed marriages; wife Dyan Cannon separating him from his daughter, his greatest love. The book is marred by the author's intrusionsfor example, his frequent speculations on whether Grant was secretly gay. Photos not seen by PW. First serial to Good Housekeeping. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grant was an actor renowned for his charm and sophistication, but Harris portrays a man considerably different from his public image. Grant dropped out of school when he 14. He was often distant, depressed, and parsimonious. He was unable to make a success of marriage until his fifth try. Most controversial is Harris's strong inference that Grant had a long-term homosexual relationship with actor Randolph Scott in the 1930s. True or not, the supposition is nothing new. Better-researched and better-written than the average movie star biography, this is a good choice for most libraries. John Smothers, Monmouth Cty.

No sounds of Doc Watson, Chet Atkins, or Stevie Ray Vaughan. You might as well imagine a song without a tune. This eye-catching book full of stunning color photos looks at the history of the pick and includes fantastic picks of every shape, design, and material. Also includes a commemorative pick!</p><p>The perfect companion to the scads of pictorial guitar retrospectives of recent years, this engagingly written and very colorfully illustrated little history of guitar plectrums is also a pop-culture collector's guide and the story of a miraculous and beautiful (but highly explosive) substance--celluloid. Picks come in an amazing array of shapes, sizes, and colors, and celluloid was ideal for them, partly because of its flexibility, but also because of its artistic qualities. It lends itself to lovely, swirling designs, to incorporating sparkling and otherwise eye-catching additives, and to better string tone, too. Unfortunately, besides its instability, it is time consuming to produce, and today, very few sources of celluloid are left. So picks are made of dozens of other materials as well, which may not enhance the playing of music as much but do open up additional niches in the collectibles environment.

Listing more than 350 historic sites throughout the state, DiIonno has compiled the most complete guide ever to the Revolutionary War in the Garden State. New Jersey&#x2019;s role in the Revolutionary War is widely overlooked. Every school kid learns about the Boston Tea Party but not the Greenwich tea burning; and about the miserable winter at Valley Forge but not Jockey Hollow. Schools fund class trips to Philadelphia&#x2019;s Independence Hall but not Princeton&#x2019;s Nassau Hall. To find history in New Jersey, all you need is DiIonno&#x2019;s book as your guide. His easy-to-read volume helps readers explore the cities and the countryside from Bergen to Cape May County to find out exactly what happened there during the Revolutionary War. While previously published books center on the highlights &#x2014; Fort Lee and Washington&#x2019;s retreat across the state, victories at Trenton and Princeton, the brutal winter encampment at Jockey Hollow and the Battle of Monmouth &#x2014; DiIonno fills in the blanks. Battlefields, churches, homes of the famous and infamous, cemeteries, parks, taverns, liberty poles, bridges, creeks, hills, museums, encampment sites, lighthouses, historical societies, walking trails, monuments, plaques&#x2014;if it played a part in or commemorates the Revolutionary War in New Jersey, DiIonno tells you what happened there, the personalities involved, and how to see it for yourself. The sites are conveniently cataloged by county, with a helpful summary of the area&#x2019;s war history beginning each chapter. Each entry lists the town and directions to each site, and where appropriate, a complete address, telephone numbers, and hours of operation. Both public and private sites are described, and DiIonno advises readers of which private sites tours can be arranged.</p><p>This bookAEs appearance in the year 2000 is well timed to be in coordination with the NationAEs 225th anniversary of the American Revolution. DiIonno provides a basis for both New Jersey residents and out-of-state visitors to experience the full breadth and depth of New JerseyAEs unique role in the war. Every history teacher and school administrator should have a copy when they make plans for school field trips. Experiencing this crucial page of history by visiting the sites of the Revolution will make this period of American history more relevant, and better understood.--Richard S.

Written by the renowned French historian, Regine Pernoud, it uses extensive excerpts from the people who actually knew Joan, bringing to life this great woman and her powerful story.<p>The whole tremendous and fascinating historical story is told here by her childhood playmates and relatives, her royal and noble friends, her confessor, her valet, her squires and heralds, and her fellow soldiers.</p><p>Included also are excerpts from some of her enemies: their presence here lends even a more powerful authenticity to her story than if we had only heard from her friends and supporters.</p><p>As we follow Pernoud through her remarkably clear, detailed tracing of this history told by living tongues, weaving the testimonies together, we begin to share with her the experience of those men who were making the investigation of Joan. Pernoud's method is direct and knowledgeable, and dedicated to the discovery and presentation of the mystical truth.</p></p><p><p><b>Regine Pernoud</b>&nbsp;is widely acclaimed as one of the great medievalists of our times.

There is not enough recognition of what this little peasant girl accomplished with divine inspiration. She ended the longest war in history, and she saved France for the Catholic Church.

While European writers of the Gothic and bizarre evoked ruined castles and crumbling abbeys, their American counterparts looked back to the Colonial era&#x2019;s stifling religion and its dark and threatening woods.<br><br> Today the best-known tale of Colonial horror is Washington Irving&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&#x201d; although Irving&#x2019;s story is probably best-known today from various movie versions it has inspired. Colonial horror tales of other prominent American authors&#x2015;Nathaniel Hawthorne and James Fenimore Cooper among them&#x2015;are overshadowed by their bestsellers and are difficult to find in modern libraries. Many other pioneers of American horror fiction are presented afresh in this breathtaking volume for today&#x2019;s reading public.<br><br> Some will have heard the names of Increase and Cotton Mather in association with the Salem witch trials, but will not have sought out their contemporary accounts of what were viewed as supernatural events. By bringing these writers to the attention of the contemporary reader, the book will help bring their names&#x2015;and their work&#x2015;back from the dead. <p><strong>Featuring stories by</strong>&nbsp;Cotton Mather, Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, James Fenimore Cooper, Edgar Allan Poe, Henry James, H.

Yet it was the moment of two significant spatial events: France&#x2019;s expansion on a global scale, and, in the spring of 1871, the brief existence of the Paris Commune - the construction of revolutionary urban space. Arguing that space, as a social fact, is always political and strategic, Kristen Ross has written a book that is at once history and geography of the Commune&#x2019;s anarchist culture - its political language and social relations, its values, strategies, and stances.<br><br>Central to her analysis of the Commune as social space and oppositional culture is a close textual reading of Arthur Rimbaud&#x2019;s poetry. His poems - a common thread running through the book - are one set of documents among many in Ross&#x2019;s recreation of the Communard experience. Rimbaud, Paul Lafargue, and the social geographer Elisee Reclus serve as emblematic figures moving within and on the periphery of the Commune; in their resistance to the logic and economy of a capitalist conception of work, in their challenge to work itself as a term of identity, all three posed a threat to the existing order. Ross looks at these and other emancipator notions as aspects of Communard life, each with an analogous strategy in Rimbaud&#x2019;s poetry. Applying contemporary theory to a wealth of little-known archival material, she has written a fresh, persuasive, and original book.<br><br></p><p>Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible to scholars, students, researchers, and general readers.

Ellen White stated: &#34;The Lord in His great mercy sent a most precious message to His people through Elders Waggoner and Jones. This message was to bring more prominently before the world the uplifted Saviour, the sacrifice for the sins of the whole world. It presented justification through faith in the Surety; it invited the people to receive the righteousness of Christ, which is made manifest in obedience to all the commandments of God. Many had lost sight of Jesus. They needed to have their eyes directed to His divine person, His merits, and His changeless love for the human family. . . . This is the message that God commanded to be given to the world. It is the third angel&#39;s message, which is to be proclaimed with a loud voice, and attended with the outpouring of His Spirit in a large measure&#34; (1888 Materials, pp. 1336-1337). Sadly, however, Ellen White also stated: &#34;An unwillingness to yield up preconceived opinions, and to accept this truth, lay at the foundation of a large share of the opposition manifested at Minneapolis against the Lord&#39;s message through Brethren Waggoner and Jones. By exciting that opposition, Satan succeeded in shutting away from our people, in a great measure, the special power of the Holy Spirit that God longed to impart to them. The enemy prevented them from obtaining that efficiency which might have been theirs in carrying the truth to the world, as the apostles proclaimed it after the day of Pentecost. The light that is to lighten the whole earth with its glory was resisted, and by the action of our own brethren has been in a great degree kept away from the world&#34; (1888 Materials, p. 1575). Thankfully though, the same latter rain is about to return!</p><p></p><h2>Abhidhamma Studies: Buddhist Explorations of Consciousness and Time</h2><p>The Abhidhamma, the third great division of early Buddhist teaching, expounds a revolutionary system of philosophical psychology rooted in the twin Buddhist insights of selflessness and dependent origination. In keeping with the liberative thrust of early Buddhism, this system organizes the entire spectrum of human consciousness around the two poles of Buddhist doctrine - bondage and liberation, Samsara and Nirvana - the starting point and the final goal. It thereby maps out, with remarkable rigour and precision, the inner landscape of the mind to be crossed through the practical work of Buddhist meditation.<br><br>In this book of groundbreaking essays, Venerable Nyanaponika Thera, one of our age's foremost exponents of Theravada Buddhism, attempts to penetrate beneath the formidable face of the Abhidhamma and to make its principles intelligible to the thoughtful reader of today. His point of focus is the Consciousness Chapter of the <i>Dhammasangani</i>, the first treatise of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. Basing his interpretation on the detailed list of mental factors that the Abhidhamma uses as a guide to psychological analysis, he launches into bold explorations in the multiple dimensions of conditionality, the nature of consciousness, the temporality of experience, and the psychological springs of spiritual transformation. Innovative and rich in insights, this book does not merely open up new avenues in the academic study of early Buddhism. By treating the Abhidhamma as a fountainhead of inspiration for philosophical and psychological inquiry, it demonstrates the continuing relevance of Buddhist thought to our most astute contemporary efforts to understand the elusive yet so intimate nature of the mind.</p><p>Nyanaponika Thera, a German-born Buddhist monk, was a scholar, translator, and founder of The Buddhist Publication Society in Sri Lanka. Thera died in 1994 at the age of 93.<b>Abhidhamma Studies<br><br>EXCERPT<br><br>Chapter 1: The Abhidhamma Philosophy: Its Estimation in the Past, Its Value for the Present</b><br><br><i>The High Esteem for the Abhidhamma in Buddhist Tradition</i><br><br>The Abhidhamma Pitaka, or the Philosophical Collection, forms the third great section of the Buddhist Pali Canon (Tipitaka). In its most characteristic parts it is a system of classifications, analytical enumerations, and definitions, with no discursive treatment of the subject matter. In particular its two most important books, the Dhammasangani and the Patthana, have the appearance of huge collections of systematically arranged tabulations, accompanied by definitions of the terms used in the tables. This, one would expect, is a type of literature scarcely likely to gain much popular appreciation. Yet the fact remains that the Abhidhamma has always been highly esteemed and even venerated in the countries of Theravada Buddhism.<br><br>Two examples taken from the chronicles of Sri Lanka illustrate this high regard for the Abhidhamma. In the tenth century C.E., on the order of King Kassapa V, the whole Abhidhamma Pitaka was inscribed on gold plates, and the first of these books, the Dhammasangani, was set with jewels. When the work was completed, the precious manuscripts were taken in a huge procession to a beautiful monastery and deposited there. Another king of Lanka, Vijayabahu (eleventh century), used to study the Dhammasangani in the early morning before he took up his royal duties, and he prepared a translation of it into Sinhala, which however has not been preserved.<br><br>What were the reasons for such an extraordinary esteem for material that appears at first glance to consist of no more than dry and unattractive textbooks? And what actual importance do the two basic works of the Abhidhamma in particular, the Dhammasangani and the Patthana, still have today? These are the questions that we shall attempt to answer here.<br><br>In considering the reasons for this high esteem and regard for the Abhidhamma, we may leave aside any manifestation of faith, more or less unquestioning, that evokes in the devotee a certain awe owing to the very abstruseness and bulk of these books. That apart, we may find a first explanation in the immediate impression on susceptible minds that they are faced here by a gigantic edifice of penetrative insight, which in its foundations and its layout cannot well be ascribed to a lesser mind than that of a Buddha; and this first impression will find growing confirmation in the gradual process of comprehending these teachings.<br><br>According to the Theravada tradition the Abhidhamma is the domain proper of the Buddhas (buddhavisaya), and its initial conception in the Master's mind (manasa desana) is traced to the time immediately after the Great Enlightenment. It was in the fourth of the seven weeks spent by the Master in the vicinity of the Bodhi Tree that the Abhidhamma was conceived. These seven days were called by the teachers of old "the Week of the House of Gems" (ratanaghara-sattaha). "The House of Gems" is indeed a very befitting expression for the crystal-clear edifice of Abhidhamma thought in which the Buddha dwelt during that period.<br><br><i>The Abhidhamma as System and Method</i><br><br>Those who have an eye for the ingenious and the significant in the architecture of great edifices of thought will probably be impressed first by the Abhidhamma's structural qualities, its wide compass, its inner consistency, and its far-reaching implications. The Abhidhamma offers an impressive systematization of the whole of reality as far as it is of concern to the final goal of the Buddha's teaching--liberation from craving and suffering; for it deals with actuality from an exclusively ethical and psychological viewpoint and with a definite practical purpose.<br><br>A strikingly impressive feature of the Abhidhamma is its analysis of the entire realm of consciousness. The Abhidhamma is the first historical attempt to map the possibilities of the human mind in a thorough and realistic way, without admixture of metaphysics and mythology. This system provides a method by which the enormous welter of facts included or implied in it can be subordinated to, and be utilized by, the liberating function of knowledge, which in the Buddha's teaching is the essential task and the greatest value of true understanding. This organizing and mustering of knowledge for such a purpose cannot fail to appeal to the practical thinker.<br><br>The Abhidhamma may also be regarded as a systematization of the doctrines contained, or implicit, in the Sutta Pitaka, the Collection of Discourses. It formulates these doctrines in strictly philosophical (paramattha) or truly realistic (yathabhuta) language that as far as possible employs terms descriptive of functions and processes without any of the conventional (vohara) and unrealistic concepts that assume a personality, an agent (as different from the act), a soul, or a substance.<br><br>These remarks about the systematizing import of the Abhidhamma may perhaps create the impression in the reader that the Abhidhamma is no more than "a mere method with only a formalistic function." Leaving aside the fact that this is not so, as we shall see later, let us first quote, against this somewhat belittling attitude, a word of Friedrich Nietzsche, himself certainly no friend of rigid systematization: "Scientific spirit rests upon insight into the method."<br><br>For the preeminently practical needs of the Buddhist the Abhidhamma fulfills the requirements stated by Bertrand Russell: "A complete description of the existing world would require not only a catalogue of the things, but also a mention of all their qualities and relations." A systematic "catalogue of things" together with their qualities, or better "functions," is given in the first book of the Abhidhamma, the Dhammasangani, a title that could well be rendered "A Catalogue (or Compendium) of Things"; and the relations, or the conditionality, of these things are treated in the Patthana.<br><br>Some who consider themselves "strong-minded" have called systems "a refuge of feeble minds." While it must be admitted that the conceptual labels supplied by systems (including the Abhidhamma) have often been misused as a surrogate for correct comprehension of reality, this does not mean that the fault lies in systematic thought itself. The fault lies, rather, in the attitude with which a system is developed and the use to which it is put. If systematic thought is cautiously and critically applied, it can fulfill a valuable function, providing "weapons of defense" against the overwhelming assault of innumerable internal and external impressions on the human mind. This unceasing influx of impressions, by sheer weight of number and diversity alone, can be either overpowering and fascinating or else confusing, intimidating, distracting, even dissolving. The only means by which the human mind can assimilate this vast world of plurality (papanca), at least partly, is with the aid of systematic and methodical thought. But systems may also be "aggressive weapons" when wielded by a mind that through its power of understanding tries to control and master the numerous experiences, actions, and reactions occurring in our inner and outer world, subordinating them to its own purposes.<br><br>The Abhidhamma system, however, is not concerned with an artificial, abstract world of "objects in themselves." Insofar as it deals with external facts at all, the respective concepts relate those "external facts" to the bondage or liberation of the human mind; or they are terms auxiliary to the tasks of the understanding and mental training connected with the work of liberation.<br><br>The basically dynamic character of the Abhidhamma system, and of the concepts it employs, goes far in preventing both rigidity and any artificial simplification of a complex and ever-changing world--the faults that those inimical to them find in all "systems." System and method bring order, coherence, and meaning into what often appears to be a world of isolated facts, which becomes amenable to our purposes only by a methodical approach. This holds true for the system of the Abhidhamma, too, in regard to the highest purpose: mind's liberation from ignorance and suffering.</p><h2>Orion and King Arthur</h2><p><p>Ben Bova's timeless hero returns . . . at the nexus of myth and history!</p><p>More than human, less than god, Orion has fought across time and space at the whims of his Creators, god-like beings from the future who toy with human history like spoiled children playing with dolls.

It was the one thing I was certain of. How I came to this time and place I knew not.<br>&#x201c;And why are you here?&#x201d; asked Sir Bors.<br>We were standing in the dingy courtyard of a hilltop fort named Amesbury, its walls nothing more than a rickety palisade of timber staves. These Britons had tried to build their forts in the way the Roman legions had, but their engineering skills were poor. They stared at the ruins of Roman aqueducts and monuments and thought that the stonework had been done by giants or magicians.<br>A few dozen men milled about the bare dirt courtyard, some leading horses, a few practicing swordplay with one another. The place smelled of dung and sweat. And fear.<br>&#x201c;I came to serve King Arthur against the Saxons,&#x201d; I said.<br>Bors&#x2019; eyes widened. &#x201c;<i>King</i> Arthur? You&#x2019;ve made him your king, have you?&#x201d;<br>I felt confused. &#x201c;I thought&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Bors planted both fists on his hips and pushed his scarred face so close to mine that I could smell the stale wine on his breath.<br>&#x201c;Ambrosius is our king, Sarmatian! Young Arthur may be his nephew, but the pup&#x2019;s still wet behind the ears. King indeed!&#x201d;<br>I said nothing.<br>Bors grumbled, &#x201c;His uncle&#x2019;s put him in charge of Amesbury fort here and sent Merlin to watch over him, but that doesn&#x2019;t make him anything more than an inexperienced babe in the woods.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&nbsp;... I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I stammered. &#x201c;I meant to say King Ambrosius.&#x201d;<br>Bors snorted with disdain.<br>My mind was spinning. I remembered Artorius as a skinny, pimply-faced boy, a captive of the Danes when I served Beowulf. I had saved him then, I dimly recalled.<br>Somewhere in my mind I knew he was to be king of the Britons, and he would lead these island people against the invading barbarians. Britain had been abandoned by the Roman Empire after centuries of their occupation. The legions had returned to Rome to fight against the hordes of Goths who were slashing into the empire&#x2019;s heartland. Britain was left to fend for itself, wide open to invasion by the barbarian Angles and Saxons.<br>Aten had put that knowledge into my mind. But why he had sent me through spacetime to Amesbury fort I did not know. Aten, the Golden One, is my master, my Creator, sneering and superior. I have died many times, in many strange and distant places, but always he brings me back, revives me to send me on still another task of pain and danger.<br>&#x201c;You are my creature, Orion,&#x201d; he has told me often. &#x201c;My hunter. I built you and you will do as I command.&#x201d;<br>I hate Aten and his mad dreams of controlling all of spacetime to suit his whims. There are other Creators, as well, haughty and demanding, toying with human history like children playing with dolls. Cruel gods and goddesses, all of them.<br>Except for Anya.<br>Anya of the gray eyes and supernal beauty. Anya is the only one among those Creators who cares at all for their creatures. Who cares for me. I love Anya and she loves me. Aten knows this and, vicious with implacable jealousy, sends me far from her, to serve him and die over and over again.<br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re big enough,&#x201d; said Sir Bors, snapping me back to the moment. &#x201c;Can you fight?&#x201d;<br>I smiled tightly. I had led Odysseos&#x2019; men over the high stone wall of Troy. I had made Mongol warriors gape at my battle prowess. I had helped Beowulf kill Grendel and its mother.<br>&#x201c;I can fight,&#x201d; I said.<br>Sir Bors barely reached to my shoulder. He was thick and solid as a barrel, though, his arms heavy with muscle. He wore only a cracked and stained leather jerkin over his tattered knee-length tunic. But he had a long Celtic broadsword belted at his hip. I was in chain mail and linen tunic, my sword strapped to my back.<br>Drawing his sword from its leather scabbard, Bors said, &#x201c;Let me see what you can do.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; a young voice cried from behind me. &#x201c;Let me test him.&#x201d;<br>I turned and saw a handsome tall nobleman walking toward us, so young that his beard hardly darkened his chin. His eyes were light and clear, flecked with gold, his shoulder-length hair a light sandy brown, almost blond. He was smiling warmly.<br>&#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; Bors said, his tone several notches softer than it had been, &#x201c;this Sarmatian&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>So this was Arthur. He had grown into a strong young man since the time when he&#x2019;d been a starveling captive of Hrothgar, king of the Scyldings, in Daneland.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got good shoulders, Bors,&#x201d; said Arthur. Then, to me, he added, &#x201c;Let us see if you know how to use your sword.&#x201d;<br>Bors objected, &#x201c;But, my lord, you shouldn&#x2019;t engage yourself with a stranger. He might be an assassin, sent to kill you!&#x201d;<br>Arthur laughed aloud. He had no fear of an assassin. He did not know that I had murdered men in other eras, at Aten&#x2019;s behest.<br>A squire, not much younger than Arthur himself, trudged up and handed him his helmet and a shield with a blood-red dragon painted on it. I drew my own sword, heard its steel tongue hiss as it came out into the sunlight. My fingers tightened on its leather-wrapped hilt.<br>&#x201c;Where is your helmet, friend, your shield?&#x201d; Arthur asked as he stood before me. His iron helmet covered his cheeks and had a nosepiece shaped like an upside-down cross.<br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t need them,&#x201d; I said.<br>His smile turned down a little. &#x201c;Pride goes before a fall, Sarmatian.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then I will fall,&#x201d; I replied.<br>Arthur shrugged, then put his shield up and advanced toward me, sword cocked in his right hand.<br>My senses went into overdrive, as they always do when I face battle. The world around me seemed to slow down, as if everything was happening in a dream. I could see Arthur&#x2019;s gold-flecked amber eyes blinking slowly over the rim of his shield. And Sir Bors stepping sideways to keep at my side. His sword was still in his hand, ready to strike me down if I endangered Arthur. I thought he was more worried that Arthur did not have the skill or experience to face a true fighting man than fearful that I was an assassin.<br>Arthur swung at me in lethargic slow motion, a powerful overhand cut that would have sliced me down to the navel if I hadn&#x2019;t danced lightly out of harm&#x2019;s way. He grunted, frowned, and advanced upon me in sluggish slow motion.<br>I feinted once to the left, then slashed at his shield, splitting it in two with a loud cracking sound. My blade would have taken Arthur&#x2019;s arm off if I hadn&#x2019;t pulled back in time.<br>Arthur&#x2019;s eyes went wide with surprise. After only a moment&#x2019;s hesitation, he tossed away the broken shield and came at me again. He smashed another mighty overhand slash at me. I parried it easily and his blade shattered into several pieces with a brittle snap.<br>&#x201c;Hold!&#x201d; Bors shouted, sticking his sword between us.<br>I stepped back.<br>If Arthur had feared that I would kill him he gave no sign of it. Instead, he tossed away the broken stub of his sword and then reached out for mine.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a fine piece of steel,&#x201d; he said admiringly as I handed the sword to him.<br>Without thinking of why, I answered, &#x201c;I know where you can get one that&#x2019;s even better, my lord.&#x201d;<br>2<br>It took hours of arguing and cajoling, but at last Arthur and I set out for the distant lake in search of the sword I promised him. Sir Bors and the other knights were dead set against the king&#x2019;s nephew traveling alone with a stranger from a distant land. Bors complained that the fort might be attacked by Saxon raiders at any time, and Arthur&#x2019;s place was where his uncle had put him. But wizened old Merlin was on my side.<br>&#x201c;The Sarmatian brings good fortune to Arthur,&#x201d; the old wizard said, stroking his long white beard as he spoke. The beard was knotted and filthy, his homespun robe even dirtier, but all the knights and squires stared at him with wide-eyed awe. They would not step closer than five paces to him; Merlin walked through the little fort&#x2019;s dung-dotted courtyard as if protected by a magical aura.<br>In truth, I saw a burning intelligence in the old man&#x2019;s narrowed eyes, a keen awareness that belied his wrinkled, ragged appearance. Beneath those shaggy gray brows his eyes were shrewd, sharp, penetrating. Was he one of the Creators in disguise?<br>To satisfy the suspicious knights, Merlin cast a spell to protect Arthur, nothing but hand-waving and muttering as far as I could see. But it seemed to satisfy Sir Bors and the others, at least enough to allow their young leader to leave the fort with me and no one else.<br>For two days we rode, and I got to know Arthur a little. He was burning for fame and glory. His highest hope was to one day be named Dux Bellorum: battle leader of his uncle&#x2019;s forces.<br>Yet, like many an untried youth, he doubted his own abilities.<br>&#x201c;I can see it in the faces of Bors and the others,&#x201d; he told me as we camped for the night in a dark, dank forest. The huge, broad-boled trees grew so thickly that much of the day we had been forced to lead our horses afoot. &#x201c;They would never follow someone so young.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They will, my lord,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;once you prove yourself in battle.&#x201d;<br>He shook his head mournfully. &#x201c;The curse of the Britons, friend Orion, is that they will not follow anyone for long.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They will follow you, my lord. I&#x2019;m sure of it.&#x201d;<br>In the darkness of the forest night I heard him make a sound that might have been a sigh. &#x201c;No, Orion. Look at us! Ambrosius calls himself high king, but who follows him? A handful, that&#x2019;s all.

She is a screenwriter and regular broadcaster and panellist for the BBC.<b>Summer 1548</b> <p> The girl, giggling and overexcited, was running in the sunlit garden, running away from her stepfather, but not so fast that he could not catch her. Her stepmother, seated in an arbor with Rosamund roses in bud all around her, caught sight of the fourteen-year-old girl and the handsome man chasing around the broad tree trunks on the smooth turf and smiled, determined to see only the best in both of them: the girl she was bringing up and the man she had adored for years. </p><p> He snatched at the hem of the girl's swinging gown and caught her up to him for a moment. "A forfeit!" he said, his dark face close to her flushed cheeks. </p><p> They both knew what the forfeit would be. Like quicksilver she slid from his grasp and dodged away, to the far side of an ornamental fountain with a broad circular bowl. Fat carp were swimming slowly in the water; Elizabeth's excited face was reflected in the surface as she leaned forward to taunt him. </p><p> "Can't catch me!" </p><p> " 'Course I can." </p><p> She leaned low so that he could see her small breasts at the top of the square-cut green gown. She felt his eyes on her and the color in her cheeks deepened. He watched, amused and aroused, as her neck flushed rosy pink. </p><p> "I can catch you any time I want to," he said, thinking of the chase of sex that ends in bed. </p><p> "Come on then!" she said, not knowing exactly what she was inviting, but knowing that she wanted to hear his feet pounding the grass behind her, sense his hands outstretched to grab at her; and, more than anything else, to feel his arms around her, pulling her against the fascinating contours of his body, the scratchy embroidery of his doublet against her cheek, the press of his thigh against her legs. </p><p> She gave a little scream and dashed away again down an <i>all�e</i> of yew trees, where the Chelsea garden ran down to the river. The queen, smiling, looked up from her sewing and saw her beloved stepdaughter racing between the trees, her handsome husband a few easy strides behind. She looked down again at her sewing and did not see him catch Elizabeth, whirl her around, put her back to the red papery bark of the yew tree and clamp his hand over her half-open mouth. </p><p> Elizabeth's eyes blazed black with excitement, but she did not struggle. When he realized that she would not scream, he took his hand away and bent his dark head. </p><p> Elizabeth felt the smooth sweep of his moustache against her lips, smelled the heady scent of his hair, his skin. She closed her eyes and tipped back her head to offer her lips, her neck, her breasts to his mouth. When she felt his sharp teeth graze her skin, she was no longer a giggling child, she was a young woman in the heat of first desire. </p><p> Gently he loosened his grip on her waist, and his hand stole up the firmly boned stomacher to the neck of her gown, where he could slide a finger down inside her linen to touch her breasts. Her nipple was hard and aroused; when he rubbed it she gave a little mew of pleasure that made him laugh at the predictability of female desire, a deep chuckle in the back of his throat. </p><p> Elizabeth pressed herself against the length of his body, feeling his thigh push forward between her legs in reply. She had a sensation like an overwhelming curiosity. She longed to know what might happen next. </p><p> When he made a movement away from her, as if to release her, she wound her arms around his back and pulled him into her again. She felt rather than saw Tom Seymour's smile of pleasure at her culpability, as his mouth came down on hers again and his tongue licked, as delicate as a cat, against the side of her mouth. Torn between disgust and desire at the extraordinary sensation, she slid her own tongue to meet his and felt the terrible intimacy of a grown man's intrusive kiss. </p><p> All at once it was too much for her, and she shrank back from him, but he knew the rhythm of this dance which she had so lightheartedly invoked, and which would now beat through her very veins. He caught at the hem of her brocade skirt and pulled it up and up until he could get at her, sliding his practiced hand up her thighs, underneath her linen shift. Instinctively she clamped her legs together against his touch until he brushed, with calculated gentleness, the back of his hand on her hidden sex. At the teasing touch of his knuckles, she melted; he could feel her almost dissolve beneath him. She would have fallen if he had not had a firm arm around her waist, and he knew at that moment that he could have the king's own daughter, Princess Elizabeth, against a tree in the queen's garden. The girl was a virgin in name alone. In reality, she was little more than a whore. </p><p> A light step on the path made him quickly turn, dropping Elizabeth's gown and putting her behind him, out of sight. Anyone could read the tranced willingness on the girl's face; she was lost in her desire. He was afraid it was the queen, his wife, whose love for him was insulted every day that he seduced her ward under her very nose: the queen, who had been entrusted with the care of her stepdaughter the princess, Queen Katherine who had sat at Henry VIII's deathbed but dreamed of this man. </p><p> But it was not the queen who stood before him on the path. It was only a girl, a little girl of about nine years old, with big solemn dark eyes and a white Spanish cap tied under her chin. She carried two books strapped with bookseller's tape in her hand, and she regarded him with a cool objective interest, as if she had seen and understood everything. </p><p> "How now, sweetheart!" he exclaimed, falsely cheerful. "You gave me a start. I might have thought you a fairy, appearing so suddenly." </p><p> She frowned at his rapid, overloud speech, and then she replied, very slowly with a strong Spanish accent, "Forgive me, sir. My father told me to bring these books to Sir Thomas Seymour and they said you were in the garden." </p><p> She proffered the package of books, and Tom Seymour was forced to step forward and take them from her hands. "You're the bookseller's daughter," he said cheerfully. "The bookseller from Spain." </p><p> She bowed her head in assent, not taking her dark scrutiny from his face. </p><p> "What are you staring at, child?" he asked, conscious of Elizabeth, hastily rearranging her gown behind him. </p><p> "I was looking at you, sir, but I saw something most dreadful." </p><p> "What?" he demanded. For a moment he was afraid she would say that she had seen him with the Princess of England backed up against a tree like a common doxy, her skirt pulled up out of the way and his fingers dabbling at her purse. </p><p> "I saw a scaffold behind you," said the surprising child, and then turned and walked away as if she had completed her errand and there was nothing more for her to do in the sunlit garden. </p><p> Tom Seymour whirled back to Elizabeth, who was trying to comb her disordered hair with fingers that were still shaking with desire. At once she stretched out her arms to him, wanting more. </p><p> "Did you hear that?" </p><p> Elizabeth's eyes were slits of black. "No," she said silkily. "Did she say something?" </p><p> "She only said that she saw the scaffold behind me!" He was more shaken than he wanted to reveal. He tried for a bluff laugh, but it came out with a quaver of fear. </p><p> At the mention of the scaffold Elizabeth was suddenly alert. "Why?" she snapped. "Why should she say such a thing?" </p><p> "God knows," he said. "Stupid little witch. Probably mistook the word, she's foreign. Probably meant throne! Probably saw the throne behind me!" </p><p> But this joke was no more successful than his bluster, since in Elizabeth's imagination the throne and the scaffold were always close neighbors. The color drained from her face, leaving her sallow with fear. </p><p> "Who is she?" Her voice was sharp with nervousness. "Who is she working for?" </p><p> He turned to look for the child but the <i>all�e</i> was empty. At the distant end of it he could see his wife walking slowly toward them, her back arched to carry the pregnant curve of her belly. </p><p> "Not a word," he said quickly to the girl at his side. "Not a word of this, sweetheart. You don't want to upset your stepmother." </p><p> He hardly needed to warn her. At the first hint of danger the girl was wary, smoothing her dress, conscious always that she must play a part, that she must survive. He could always rely on Elizabeth's duplicity. She might be only fourteen but she had been trained in deceit every day since the death of her mother, she had been an apprentice cheat for twelve long years. And she was the daughter of a liar -- two liars, he thought spitefully. She might feel desire; but she was always more alert to danger or ambition than to lust. He took her cold hand and led her up the <i>all�e</i> toward his wife Katherine. He tried for a merry smile. "I caught her at last!" he called out. </p><p> He glanced around, he could not see the child anywhere. "We had such a race!" he cried. </p><p> I was that child, and that was the first sight I ever had of the Princess Elizabeth: damp with desire, panting with lust, rubbing herself like a cat against another woman's husband. But it was the first and last time I saw Tom Seymour. Within a year, he was dead on the scaffold charged with treason, and Elizabeth had denied three times having anything more than the most common acquaintance with him. </p><p> Copyright � 2004 by Philippa Gregory Limited</p></p><h2>Chateau Country: Du Pont Estates in the Brandywine Valley</h2><p>Originally from France, the du Pont family settled in the Brandywine River Valley. Chateau Country is an intimate portrait of the houses built by this Delaware dynasty. Their first dwelling was a modest six-room house just steps from the gunpowder mills that made the du Ponts wealthy. One hundred years later, their largest house had 176 rooms and thirty-six servants on 2,300 acres of land. Since company founder E.I. du Pont built Eleutherian Mills in 1802, almost one hundred houses have been built nearby and occupied by his descendants. Many spectacular estate houses have been razed, but thirty-three du Pont family properties that still exist are explored and accompanied by anecdotes. Some, including Eleutherian Mills, Longwood, Gibraltar, Nemours, and Winterthur, are open to the public; others remain hidden behind stone walls. Chateau Country takes readers inside these houses and describes a way of life that has all but disappeared.</p><p>Daniel DeKalb Miller owned a hotel representative company in New York.

In Moscow, a man points on a map to the place where he was born. He is a Doukhobor, a &#39;spirit-wrestler&#39;, a member of a group of radical Russian sectarians. He is pointing to a village beyond the southern steppe, at the far south of the old Russian empire: &#39;I was born here,&#39; he says. &#39;On the edge of the world.&#39; So begins Philip Marsden&#39;s Russian journey -- perhaps the most penetrating account of Russian life since the Soviet Union&#39;s collapse made travel possible again. In villages unseen by outsiders since before the revolution, he encounters men and women of fabulous courage, larger than life, dazed by the century&#39;s turbulence. By turns wise, devout, comic, they seem to have stepped straight from the pages of Turgenev, Gogol and Babel. Marsden meets such figures as the Yezidi Sheikh of Sheikhs, an exiled Georgian prince and a cast of passionate scholars, stooping survivors of the gulags, strutting Cossacks and extreme, isolated sects of Milk-Drinkers and Spirit-Wrestlers. The Spirit-Wrestlers peels away the grey facade of post-Soviet Russia and reveals a people as committed as ever to answering that great Tolstoyan question: how a man should live. Even more than in The Bronski House and The Crossing Place, Philip Marsden shows that behind the horrors of the Soviet years the human spirit remained triumphant. In so doing, he shows himself to be one of the most exciting and original travel writers of his generation.</p><p>Philip Marsden is the author of A Far Country: Travels in Ethiopia, The Crossing Place: Among the Armenians (which won the Somerset Maugham Award) and The Bronski House, and is the editor of The Spectator Book of Travel Writing.</p><h2>The Coming of the Lord</h2><p>Could there be a subject more compelling than the Savior&#39;s Second Coming?

Freund devises an exciting framework for his tale, introducing us to the three objects one piece at a time, then to each antique's present owner, then to the sales people at Sotheby's and elsewhere who are handling each piece, then to the former owners of each piece--all of this building up to the big auction at book's end. Most richly done is the coverage of who made what when, passages that soak us in the handicrafts of the Colonies. There's a pine blanket-chest with false drawers, still coated with its original robin's-egg blue paint, made for a Connecticut farmer in 1750 or so--an object so utterly plain and unadorned in the Queen Anne style that the reader (and visitors to the Winter Antiques Show where it's being exhibited) can hardly believe anyone will pay the present owner's $250,000 asking price. Then there's a fabulous Chippendale card table, decorated by a genius for carving vines and leaves that seemingly turn in the wind and catch raindrops, a piece made in 1759 for a Philadelphia millionaire and whose breath-of- life carving Freund describes as fondly as Pygmalion might describe Galatea's hip. Will it go for a million? The inlaid sofa table from the Federal period, which has passed through the fond hands of many millionaires--$100,000? Connoisseurship that floods the reader's cells like fine brandy and Havanas. The passages about the lost time recaptured in each piece sing. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This is such an interesting--at times even exciting--look at the American antiques trade that it's unfortunate the material is presented in such a convoluted style. Freund, a freelance writer, relates so much trivia that he frequently goes off track, as, for example, when he takes paragraphs to tell us that one dealer once met an antiques "picker" whose father was a newspaper editor. Yet the book is otherwise notable, for Freund accurately reads the pulse of the trade, appreciates the love of "things" that causes many dealers and collectors to be forever on the prowl. Here he focuses on the annual Americana Week in Manhattan--in this instance, 1991--which opens with the Winter Antiques Show and includes events at auction galleries. He tracks three masterpieces of 18th-century American furniture--a sofa table, which fetched $75,000 at Sotheby's; a card table, auctioned also at Sotheby's for $950,000; and a blanket chest, priced at $250,000, which failed to sell at the Winter Antiques Show. He traces the provenance of each piece and introduces us to such major dealers as Harold Sack and to the first-rank auctioneers and collectors. The book will enthrall those for whom patina is all. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>I See the Moon and the Moon Sees Me</h2><p>A lyrical adaptation of a classic nursery rhyme, combined with vibrant full-color artwork, celebrates one child&#39;s enjoyment of the natural world over the course of a day, from sunrise to evening.</p><p>Jonathan London is the creator of twenty-three books about lovable and enduringly popular Froggy.

The very first bastide, the astonishingly beautiful Cordes, was created in 1222 in the wake of the bloody legacy of Catharism and the Albigensian crusade, to provide prosperity and protection for its population. All the other bastides were founded either by the English or the French within the space of 150 years, and continued to develop until the seventeenth century. Most have survived as lovely small towns in spectacular countryside, and almost two hundred are discussed, and many also illustrated, in this book.<br>The bastides are both visually and architecturally stunning, characterized by elaborate rings of fortifications, huge arcaded market squares, chequer-board patterns of urban layout, and exquisite combinations of wood and stone pillars and vaulting. Many endured the Hundred Years War and later the wars of religion to survive today, not as museum pieces but as animated spots, still hosts to the regular markets and fairs whose charters were granted back in the thirteenth century.<br>The author writes an authoritative and entertaining account of the history of the bastides, discussing their origins, their fate during the vicissitudes of war, the realities of medieval daily life within their walls and their unique architectural styles. He also brings vividly to life the strong personalities of their founders, such as the counts of Toulouse and Gaston Febus, who likened himself to the sun-god, and those of a supporting cast of colourful characters. His detailed research into this period of medieval history and his immediate response to the beauties of the bastides themselves combine to create a compelling read. The book's extensive gazetteer, which, describes the artistic attractions and the dates of markets and events in all the bastides, also makes this an invaluable guide to southwest France.</p><p>Text: French</p><h2>Don&#39;t Tell the Newfoundlanders: The True Story of Newfoundland&#39;s Confederation with Canada</h2><p>The true story, drawn from official documents and hours of personal interviews, of how Newfoundland and Labrador joined Confederation and became Canada's tenth province in 1949.

And as with every relationship that matters, we tend to take it for granted.<br><br>When everything works just right, men get to enjoy some of life's greatest pleasures: attraction, sex, desire, the making of children. And when everything is working right, why try to understand how it all operates? That would take all the romance out of it.<br><br>At a certain point, however, it becomes important for a man and his reproductive system to get acquainted in a whole new way. This time comes right around midlife--the point at which things can start to go wrong "down there." For a substantial proportion of men, sexual function or libido might decline. Urinary difficulties might start to show up. Or a routine physical might lead to a diagnosis of prostate problems: enlargement of the prostate gland, a urinary tract infection, a questionable result from the blood test used to detect prostate cancer (the PSA screening test), or even prostate cancer.<br><br>Many men have never really thought about the fact that their bodies contain prostate glands until they receive a diagnosis of prostate disease. Few men know much about where this gland is or what it does until it starts to malfunction (or, as is often the case, until cancerous cells are detected long before any malfunctioning becomes evident--which can seem like an ambush to a man who feels great one moment and becomes a cancer patient the next). But a lot of men are getting this wake-up call.<br><br>In the late 1980s, urologists began to use the PSA blood test to detect prostate cancer. Since that time, diagnoses have become far more common. Overall, the rate of prostate cancer diagnosis has risen by 67 percent since the middle of the 20th century. Today, 18 percent of men can expect to get a diagnosis of prostate cancer at some point in their lives. And just under 20 percent of men ages 55 to 74 develop some clinical signs of benign prostate enlargement.<br><br>Rates of prostate cancer are rising in part because of earlier detection and in part because the population is aging--prostate cancer is primarily a disease of older men. However, because of routine screening with the PSA test, we are now detecting this cancer in men in their forties and fifties. Getting to know your prostate couldn't hurt, because chances are good that you're going to end up addressing one or another prostate issue in your lifetime.<br><br>It's Okay to Be Scared . . .<br><br>My best guess is that there's only one reason you have this book in your hands: You or someone you love has been diagnosed with prostate cancer or is at an especially high risk of developing the disease. Taking this step to inform yourself is commendable, especially if you're doing so in the days or weeks just after receiving a cancer diagnosis. This period of time can certainly be an emotional roller coaster.<br><br>If you are feeling traumatized and wish you weren't, or think that if you were truly manly, you wouldn't be feeling fearful or sad, you should know that these feelings are significant and in no way inconsequential. There's research to prove this: In one Harvard Medical School study of 350,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1979 and 2004, rates of suicide and death from heart attack and stroke--both of which can be linked to psychological stress--jumped during the first months following diagnosis.<br><br>The good news here is that this spike in death rates in the months following diagnosis stopped after 1993, when early detection efforts began in earnest. When the prognosis is good--as it is when prostate cancer is diagnosed in its earliest stages--the trauma is much less severe than when the cancer is diagnosed after it has spread too far to be curable. When the issues you face have more to do with making treatment choices in the interest of healing than with having to acknowledge a grim prognosis, psychological health isn't likely to crash and burn. You know you can do a lot to help yourself.<br><br>One reason for the enormous stress that used to accompany a prostate cancer diagnosis was the level of risk most treatments entailed--treatments that could be devastating to that all-important relationship between a man and his reproductive system. When I was a medical resident in the early 1990s, about half of men who underwent treatment for prostate cancer ended up impotent. Half ended up with urinary incontinence. The significant risks of impotence and/or incontinence made treatment choices close to impossible to make for some men.<br><br>Over the past 2 decades, death rates from prostate cancer have fallen, and treatments are now head and shoulders above what they once were, in terms of both effectiveness and reduced risk of side effects. Our rates of survival and cure from this disease are the highest ever, and in the last decade we have made many great advances in our understanding of the biology of prostate cancer cells, which has led us to vastly improved treatments.<br><br>Most important, we are learning that many men diagnosed with prostate cancer using modern early detection techniques do not need immediate treatment. A proportion of these men may never need treatment at all. That is why I believe this book is so needed: Men and their loved ones need to know that they can make an educated choice to postpone treatment, and they need a measured and up-to-date perspective on how to make this choice for themselves. In addition, they need to know that "watch and wait" can become a much more empowered process of "watch, wait, and act" when the holistic strategies described in this book are employed.<br><br>If you're not familiar with the idea of holistic therapies, you might imagine that they're about as valid as voodoo, astrology, alien abduction, or psychokinetics. But the reality is that herbal medicine, diet, and other "alternative" therapies are now converging with mainstream science-based, evidence-based medicine. One of the places where this is happening is my Center for Holistic Urology. In this book, I will not recommend any holistic therapy that does not have a solid basis in scientific validity and peer-reviewed research studies--for the most part, the same kinds of studies done on the drugs approved by the FDA and prescribed by doctors every day.<br><br>My primary aim in this book is to provide you with all the information you need following a diagnosis of prostate cancer, even if you are living with the disease and ongoing tests show that the cancer may have come back after treatment. To put all of this information to good use, you'll need to make a deeper, more detailed acquaintance with your prostate gland and with some other parts that reside in the same general neighborhood in the male body.<br><br>Your Prostate: An Overview<br><br>The prostate gland is actually an integral part of the reproductive system. Situated underneath the bladder, wrapped around the urethra (the tube that carries both urine and semen out of the body), and nestled up against the front side of the rectum, the prostate is a gland made up of multiple lobes and encased in a membrane. The section of the urethra that passes through the prostate is the prostatic urethra.<br><br>A healthy young man's prostate weighs in at just over 3/4 ounce and is roughly the size of a large walnut or a small plum. During the buildup to ejaculation, the prostate secretes liquid through small pores that lie between it and the prostatic urethra. This liquid nourishes and carries sperm as they pass through the urethra on their voyage out.<br><br>On either side of the prostate sit seminal vesicles, which are small, pouchlike glands that contribute secretions to semen. Next to the seminal vesicles are Cowper's glands, which produce fluids that lubricate the urethra. Right at the confluence of these vesicles with the top of the prostate gland, two delicate vas deferentia (translation: vessels that carry away) also enter the urethra. Each of the vas deferentia extends from one of the testicles and up and around the bladder to get where they need to go.<br><br>The testicles, of course, are where sperm are produced. Immature sperm convene in the epididymis on top of each testicle. They mature there and wait for their big chance--the next ejaculation--at which point the vas deferentia contract rhythmically and draw sperm out to their date with destiny. Testicles also produce testosterone, the hormone that gives men sexual drive and the ability to have an erection. Testosterone also causes the growth of the prostate gland. One of the ways we can cause cancer to regress is to remove the ability of the testicles to produce this hormone. Today, we can do this surgically or with medications.<br><br>You may recognize the word root vas as the same one that initiates that dreaded word vasectomy--a procedure that severs or closes off these tubes to prevent sperm from leaving the body. It's interesting to note that some studies have found a link between vasectomy and prostate cancer. If you've already been through this procedure, you probably can't blame your prostate problems on it. Today, most evidence fails to support any connection between vasectomy and prostate cancer.<br><br>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the enzyme measured in the bloodstream by the PSA test, is produced within the prostate. Its purpose is to keep semen liquid so that it flows easily. When semen enters a woman's vagina, enzymatic reactions cause the sperm to clump up in a gel-like mass at the entrance to the cervix. Within a half hour, PSA dissolves the gel, allowing sperm to swim for their ultimate goal--to fertilize an egg and make a new human being.<br><br>In a healthy prostate, very little PSA escapes from the gland into the bloodstream. Thus, an elevated PSA level may be a reflection that some pathological process is going on within the gland.<br><br>The PSA test is not a cancer test. A finding of elevated PSA can indicate several conditions. It may be cancer, or it may be prostatitis (a non- cancerous inflammation of the prostate), or it may be just a large prostate due to a benign growth, otherwise known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Ejaculating or getting a digital rectal exam (DRE) will also make PSA rise. You'll learn everything you ever wanted to know (and perhaps more) about PSA in Chapter 7, where this topic is addressed in great detail.<br><br>Most men's prostate glands grow bigger and heavier as they age. At birth, a baby boy's prostate weighs a little less than 1/2 ounce, and it goes through growth surges in adolescence and in the mid-twenties. It's normal for a man's prostate to grow again starting in his fifties, in part because of changes in hormone balance that are typical of men in midlife. The average man's prostate enlarges by about one-quarter in the last half of life.<br><br>Some men's prostates grow more than others. Surgeons at Weill Cornell Medical College reported removing a prostate gland that weighed 18 ounces from one patient--it was the size of two grapefruits, big enough to fill the man's entire pelvis with prostate tissue. Enlargement is usually much less severe than this. And the size of a man's prostate does not necessarily predict whether he will need treatment for prostate enlargement. Some prostates grow outward without squeezing the urethra and limiting urine flow. At the other extreme, a man's prostate can grow only a small amount, but because it expands inward, it can restrict or stop the flow of urine, making treatment essential. (I'll address prostate enlargement in much more detail in Chapter 11.)<br><br>The tissues and cell type of the prostate gland are actually very similar to the tissues that make up female breasts. Breasts are made up of lobes that produce fluid and ducts that allow that fluid to pass out of the lobes and be concentrated in one place; so is the prostate gland. Both types of tissue also control the flow of the fluids they produce. Like breasts, the prostate is highly sensitive to sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone. Unlike breasts, the prostate is partially made up of muscle, which contracts during ejaculation to move prostatic fluids into the urethra and to move semen along on its path.<br><br>Although a man with prostate disease isn't likely to want to think about this point too much, the prostate gland is also a sexual organ. It is sensitive to stimulation and plays an important role in the overall sensations of orgasm. Some men have discovered this for the first time while having a digital rectal exam at the doctor's office. It's not unusual for a man to become aroused or even to ejaculate during a DRE. The prostate has even been called "the male G-spot."<br><br>Now that you have the general lay of the land, let's look at what can go wrong with this small bit of male pelvic real estate. Although the emphasis in this book is on prostate cancer, I'll start here with the most common prostatic issue in men over 50: benign prostatic hyperplasia.<br><br>Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy, aka Prostate Enlargement, aka "the Growing Problem"<br><br>As I mentioned earlier, a substantial percentage of men in midlife and beyond develop BPH serious enough to cause urinary problems. They may notice that they have to get up to urinate more often during the night or that they need to urinate more in general. Difficulty starting the urine stream, weak urine stream, small urine volume, feeling of not having emptied the bladder completely, or blood in the urine can all suggest BPH. These can also be symptoms of prostate cancer, so any man I see in my office who is complaining of symptoms like these will be evaluated for both conditions.<br><br>Despite intense research over the past few years, medical science isn't sure what causes the prostate to enlarge and result in BPH. There are two predominant theories, both of which have to do with changing hormone balance during the midlife years and beyond. Neither theory has been proven conclusively, and neither theory seems to explain every case of BPH.<br><br>As a man ages, his production of the masculinizing hormone testosterone decreases. Men's bodies also produce estrogens, which are thought of as female hormones but are actually produced in the adrenal glands of men's bodies, as well as in stored fat. Estrogen is a growth promoter: It stimulates the growth of tissues--particularly those of the sexual organs, including the prostate. Thus, BPH may result when estrogen production stays the same while testosterone production diminishes.<br><br>A form of testosterone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is believed to play a significant role in BPH. It has a directly stimulating effect on prostate tissue--in other words, it makes prostate tissue grow. Studies have demonstrated that if no DHT is present, prostate enlargement doesn't happen (on a side note, male pattern baldness also requires the presence of DHT). Heightened DHT levels in the prostate are linked with greater risk of prostate enlargement.</p><h2>The Race Against the Stasi: The Incredible Story of Dieter Wiedemann, the Iron Curtain and the Greatest Cycling Race on Earth</h2><p><p><b>Cycling Book of the Year 2015 - Cross British Sports Book Award</b></p> <p>Unbeknownst to the authorities, however, he had fallen in love with Sylvia Hermann, a girl from the other side of the wall. Socialist doctrine had it that the two of them were 'class enemies', and as a famous athlete Dieter's every move was pored over by the Stasi.

The Stasi sought to 'repatriate' him, with horrific consequences both for him and the family he left behind. Fifty years on, and twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dieter Wiedemann decided it was time to tell his story. Through his testimony and that of others involved, and well as through the Stasi file - an organization that has stalked him for half a century - Herbie Sykes uncovers an astonishing tale.

He cultivates empty affairs and the land he owns with an eye toward profit and loss. Perhaps Nadia May&#39;s straightforward narration reflects the flat, detached quality of this existence too well; her voice scarcely changes pace or emotional intensity. While this reading style suits the story&#39;s mood, it drags. Fortunately, May provides relief by skillfully adapting her mild British accent to the dialects of the various social classes.

Belinda now lives in Wales.<b><b>Chapter 1<br> </b></b> <p>EXMOOR DRIPPED WITH DIRTY BRACKEN, ROUGH, COLORLESS grass, prickly gorse, and last year&#x2019;s heather, so black it looked as if wet fire had swept across the landscape, taking the trees with it and leaving the moor cold and exposed to face the winter unprotected. Drizzle dissolved the close horizons and blurred heaven and earth into a grey cocoon around the only visible landmark&#x2014;a twelve-year-old boy in slick black waterproof trousers but no hat, alone with a spade. </p><p>It had rained for three days, but the roots of grass and heather and gorse twisting through the soil still resisted the spade&#x2019;s intrusion. Steven&#x2019;s expression did not change; he dug the blade in again, feeling a satisfying little impact all the way up to his armpits. This time he made a mark&#x2014;a thin human mark in the great swathe of nature around him. </p><p>Before Steven could make the next mark, the first narrow stripe had filled with water and disappeared. </p><p>Three boys slouched through the Shipcott rain, their hands deep in their pockets, their hoodies over their faces, their shoulders hunched as if they couldn&#x2019;t wait to get out of the rain. But they had nowhere to hurry to, so they meandered and bumped along and laughed and swore too loudly at nothing at all, just to let the world know they were there and still had expectations. </p><p>The street was narrow and winding and, in summer, passing tourists smiled at the seaside-painted terraces with their doors opening right onto the pavement and their quaint shutters. But the rain made the yellow and pink and sky blue houses a faded reminder of sunshine, and a refuge only for those too young, too old, or too poor to leave. </p><p>Steven&#x2019;s nan looked out of the window with a steady gaze. </p><p>She had started life as Gloria Manners. Then she became Ron Peters&#x2019;s wife. After that, she was Lettie&#x2019;s mum, then Lettie and Billy&#x2019;s mum. Then for a long time she was Poor Mrs. Peters. Now she was Steven&#x2019;s nan. But underneath she would always be Poor Mrs. Peters; nothing could change that, not even her grandsons. </p><p>Above the half-nets, the front window was spotted with rain. The people over the road already had their lights on. The roofs were as different as the walls. Some still wore their old pottery tiles, rough with moss. Others, flat grey slate that reflected the watery sky. Above the roofs, the top of the moor was just visible through the mist&#x2014;a gentle, rounded thing from this distance. From the warmth of a front room with central heating and the kettle starting to whistle in the kitchen, it even looked innocent. </p><p>The shortest of the boys struck the window with the flat of his palm and Steven&#x2019;s nan recoiled in fright. </p><p>The boys laughed and ran although no one was chasing them and they knew no one was likely to. &#x201c;Nosey old bag!&#x201d; one of them shouted back, although it was hard to see which, with their hoods so low on their faces. </p><p>Lettie hurried in, breathless and alarmed. &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; </p><p>But Steven&#x2019;s nan was back in the window. She didn&#x2019;t look round at her daughter. &#x201c;Is tea ready?&#x201d; she said. </p><p>Steven walked off the moor with his anorak slung over one shoulder and his T-shirt soaked and steaming with recent effort. The track carved through the heather by generations of walkers was thick with mud. He stopped&#x2014;his rusty spade slung over his other shoulder like a rifle&#x2014;and looked down at the village. The streetlamps were already on and Steven felt like an angel or an alien, observing the darkening dwellings from on high, detached from the tiny lives being lived below. He ducked instinctively as he saw the three hoodies run down the wet road. </p><p>He hid the spade behind a rock near the slippery stile. It was rusty but, still, someone might take it, and he couldn&#x2019;t carry it home with him; that might lead to questions he could not&#x2014;or dared not&#x2014;answer. </p><p>He walked down the narrow passage beside the house. He was cooling now, and shivered as he took off his trainers to run them under the garden tap. They&#x2019;d been white once, with blue flashes. His mum would go mad if she saw them like this. He rubbed them with his thumbs and squeezed the mud out of them until they were only dirty, then shook them hard. Muddy water sprayed up the side of the house, but rain washed it quickly away. His grey school socks were heavy and sodden; he peeled them off, his feet a shocking cold white. </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re soaking.&#x201d; His mother peered from the back door, her face pinched and her dark blue eyes as dull as a northern sea. Rain spattered the straw hair that was dragged back into a small, functional ponytail. She jerked her head back inside to keep it dry. </p><p>&#x201c;I got caught in it.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Where were you?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;With Lewis.&#x201d; </p><p>This was not strictly a lie. He had been with Lewis immediately after school. </p><p>&#x201c;What were you doing?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. Just. You know.&#x201d; </p><p>From the kitchen he heard his nan say, &#x201c;He should come straight home from school!&#x201d; </p><p>Steven&#x2019;s mother glared at his wetness. &#x201c;Those trainers were only new at Christmas.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, Mum.&#x201d; He looked crestfallen; it often worked. </p><p>She sighed. &#x201c;Tea&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d; </p><p>Steven ate as fast as he dared and as much as he could. Lettie stood at the sink and smoked and dropped her ash down the plughole. At the old house&#x2014;before they came to live with Nan&#x2014;his mum used to sit at the table with him and Davey. She used to eat. She used to talk to him. Now her mouth was always shut tight, even when it held a cigarette. </p><p>Davey sucked the ketchup off his chips then carefully pushed each one to the side of his plate. </p><p>Nan cut little pieces off her breaded fish, inspecting each with a suspicious look before eating it. </p><p>&#x201c;Something wrong with it, Mum?&#x201d; Lettie flicked her ash with undue vigor. Steven looked at her nervously. </p><p>&#x201c;Bones.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a fillet. Says so on the box. Plaice fillet.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;They always miss some. You can&#x2019;t be too careful.&#x201d; </p><p>There was a long silence in which Steven listened to the sound of his own food inside his head. </p><p>&#x201c;Eat your chips, Davey.&#x201d; </p><p>Davey screwed up his face. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all wet.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Should&#x2019;ve thought of that before you sucked them, shouldn&#x2019;t you? Shouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; </p><p>At the repeated question, Steven stopped chewing, but Nan&#x2019;s fork scraped the plate. </p><p>Lettie moved swiftly to Davey&#x2019;s side and picked up a soggy chip. &#x201c;Eat it!&#x201d; </p><p>Davey shook his head and his lower lip started to wobble. </p><p>With quiet spite, Nan murmured: &#x201c;Leaving food. Kids nowadays don&#x2019;t know they&#x2019;re born.&#x201d; </p><p>Lettie bent down and slapped Davey sharply on the bare thigh below his shorts. Steven watched the white handprint on his brother&#x2019;s skin quickly turn red. He loved Davey, but seeing someone other than himself get into trouble always gave Steven a small thrill, and now&#x2014;watching his mother hustling his brother out of the kitchen and up the stairs, bawling his head off&#x2014;he felt as if he had somehow been accorded an honor: the honor of being spared the pent-up irritation of his mother. God knows, she&#x2019;d taken her feelings for Nan out on him often enough. But this was further proof of what Steven had been hoping for some time&#x2014;that Davey was finally old enough, having just turned five, to suffer his share of the discipline pool. It wasn&#x2019;t a deep pool, or a dangerous one, but what the hell; his mother had a short fuse and a punishment shared was a punishment halved in Steven&#x2019;s eyes. Maybe even a punishment escaped altogether. </p><p>His nan had not stopped eating throughout, although each mouthful was apparently a minefield. </p><p>Even though Davey&#x2019;s sobs were now muffled, Steven sought eye contact with Nan and finally she glanced at him, giving him a chance to roll his eyes, as if the burden of the naughty child was shared and the sharing made them closer. </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re no better,&#x201d; she said, and went back to her fish. </p><p>Steven reddened. He knew he was better! If only he could prove it to Nan, everything would be different&#x2014;he just knew it. </p><p>Of course, it was all Billy&#x2019;s fault&#x2014;as usual. </p><p>Steven held his breath. He could hear his mother washing up&#x2014;the underwater clunking of china&#x2014;and his nan drying&#x2014;the higher musical scraping of plates leaving the rack. Then he slowly opened the door of Billy&#x2019;s room. It smelled old and sweet, like an orange left under the bed. Steven felt the door click gently behind him. </p><p>The curtains were drawn&#x2014;always drawn. They matched the bedspread in pale and dark blue squares that clashed with the swirly brown carpet. A half-built Lego space station was on the floor and since Steven&#x2019;s last visit a small spider had spun a web on what looked like a crude docking station. Now it sat there, waiting to capture satellite flies from the outer space of the dingy bedroom. </p><p>There was a drooping scarf pinned to the wall over the bed&#x2014;sky blue and white, Manchester City&#x2014;and Steven felt the familiar pang of pity and anger at Billy: still a loser even in death. </p><p>Steven crept in here sometimes, as if Billy might reach across the years and whisper secrets and solutions into the ear of this nephew who had already lived to see one more birthday than he himself had managed. </p><p>Steven had long ago given up the hope of finding real-life clues. At first he liked to imagine that Uncle Billy might have left some evidence of a precognition of his own death. A <i>Famous Five</i> book dogeared at a key page; the initials &#x201c;AA&#x201d; scratched into the wooden top of the bedside table; Lego scattered to show the points of the compass and X marks the spot. Something which&#x2014;after the event&#x2014;an observant boy might discover and decipher. </p><p>But there was nothing.

On that day I married my prince in the middle of the gently winding Hanalei River, on the north shore of the garden island of Kaua&#x2019;i. Ever resourceful, my prince lashed together a pair of canoes and affixed a platform on top of them, then decorated it with purple orchids, tuberose, and plumeria. During the only sun break of the day, we exchanged vows.<br> <br>My prince was bare-chested and wore a pareo, a wrap-around skirt traditional for men of the Pacific Islands. He looked even more studly than usual. I wore a white Calvin Klein bikini beneath a sheer white Donna Karan dress. I might as well just confirm what you&#x2019;re already thinking: I looked completely fabulous. (What you don&#x2019;t know, of course, is that I was a hot mess only an hour before, madly doing laundry and scrubbing the bathroom for our out-of-town visitors.)<br> <br>After the ceremony, we repaired with our dozen guests, close friends all, to Hanalei Bay, where we had a champagne picnic. It was the perfect ending to the fairy-tale courtship that had begun two years ago that very day.<br> <br>Naturally, four years later I filed for divorce.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>My childhood was rough enough to knock the belief in happily ever after clean out of my heart. My parents split when I was too young to remember; then, when I was five, my dad died in a plane crash. I&#x2019;ve always been one of those hard-headed chicks who believe that we&#x2019;re all responsible for our own happiness. Still, when I married Laird I was confident I&#x2019;d found my soul mate. Who could be more perfect for me than a guy who was my height&#x2014;six feet three&#x2014;and was even more intense and focused than I was?<br> <br>Laird and I met in 1995 while I was shooting a TV show called The Extremists. Like pretty much everything else these days, you can find it online. I was twenty-five and wore an oversized white T-shirt. My hair&#x2014;are those bangs?&#x2014;is whipping around in the wind. The sky behind me is angry with bruise-colored clouds.<br> <br>&#x201c;Today I&#x2019;m hangin&#x2019; with an extremist who catches some serious waves,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;His name is Laird Hamilton and he lives for the big swell.&#x201d;<br> <br>I ask him whether he considers this to be a big swell day, and even though it looks as if a hurricane is about to roll in at any second, he says no. Laird looked exactly the same way he looks right this minute: tan and focused. You can see us falling in love right there on camera. Ten days later we moved in together.<br> <br>We didn&#x2019;t even make it to our fifth anniversary before our sexy fairy tale turned into one of those unwatchable Swedish domestic dramas that makes the audience want to throw themselves off the nearest bridge. We were so simpatico in so many ways, but stupidly we&#x2019;d counted on this fact to remain immutable and provide an unshakable foundation for our relationship. Our love was and is complex. We were lovers, friends, and partners. We weren&#x2019;t simply hot for each other, or companionable good friends, or a couple who had been together so long marriage was the obvious next step. We had it all covered; then, without knowing how it happened, we&#x2019;d become two really tall near-strangers stomping around the house, fuming, slamming doors, and glaring at each other over our green smoothies.<br> <br>How clueless was I about marriage, about living under the same roof with another human being with&#x2014;surprise!&#x2014;his own personality and his own life? Those who know my husband call him the Weatherman. I don&#x2019;t put a lot of stock in astrology, but he is one of the world&#x2019;s primo watermen and a Pisces&#x2014;known for their deep sensitivity and mutable moods. It took being married to him to learn that he was more emotional than I&#x2019;d ever imagined, and moody. Life with Laird: it&#x2019;s windy, no wait, it&#x2019;s raining, wait, wait, now it&#x2019;s sunny. It hardly mattered what put him in a mood (if you guessed it usually had to do with there being no surfable waves that day, you&#x2019;d be right), because like the temperamental weather in Kaua&#x2019;i where he grew up, it would all blow over in a few hours.<br> <br>The problem was not the moods&#x2014;that&#x2019;s who the guy is&#x2014;but me. I took every slammed cupboard door personally. I thought, if he loved me, he&#x2019;d be happy most of the time. I&#x2019;m not the Weatherman, it&#x2019;s never windy/rainy/sunny with me. It&#x2019;s San Diego with me, 75 degrees all year long. I&#x2019;m constant and true, but I hang on to shit. His mood, the one that would make me feel unloved, would be long gone, but I&#x2019;d still be feeling the sting of it, the injustice. I&#x2019;d still be experiencing his mood, long after he was out of it.<br> <br>But I would never say anything, which became the problem that compounded the problem, a layer cake of misery. It&#x2019;s never one thing that tanks the economy or ruins a marriage. I didn&#x2019;t communicate, didn&#x2019;t tell him when he was being a jackass, didn&#x2019;t tell him how hurt my feelings were. I thought that when you love somebody you don&#x2019;t make a fuss. As a professional athlete, one of the first things I&#x2019;d learned was to suck it up, and that&#x2019;s what I thought you did when the person with whom you were in a relationship was an ass. You sucked it up.<br> <br>My friends would come over, and if Laird was in a mood, I would warn them to tread lightly. I would fret when the surf report was bad. My mantra was don&#x2019;t rock the boat. But after three years of tiptoeing around the Weatherman and his mercurial moods, I thought: peace out, I can&#x2019;t do this anymore. I was curbing my personality for his sake. I was becoming bitter and resentful. And if there&#x2019;s one thing that trashes a love story, it&#x2019;s resentment.<br> <br>To make matters more challenging still, when Laird and I got together, my career was, well, bigger, grander, whatever you want to call it, than his. I was captaining a team on the professional beach volleyball circuit, scoring glossy magazine covers with the matching big feature stories, hosting The Extremists. I&#x2019;d just signed a contract to write a book, and I was set to make my film debut. I had a sponsorship with Nike, and I was the first female athlete to have her own shoe. By all the markers by which people measure quote unquote success, I had them and Laird didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>This made me ridiculously uncomfortable. If there&#x2019;s one person on earth who truly does not give a shit about fame and worldly success, it&#x2019;s my husband. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. The dude is bursting with ambition, but it&#x2019;s the ambition to have the most fun surfing the biggest, best wave for as long as he possibly can, the ambition to keep the sport of surfing exciting and relevant into the future. Even to this day, we&#x2019;ll be watching some news show and I&#x2019;ll say check out this guy, he&#x2019;s Prince Fabulous, he&#x2019;s got this, that, and the other: a great gig, an innovative idea, money for nothing, and chicks for free. Laird is unmoved. He&#x2019;s got a clarity about what&#x2019;s important, always has. He&#x2019;s only interested in how people are in the world, what they do, how they act. He&#x2019;s never swept up in the hoopla.<br> <br>Still, during the few first years we were together, Neptune, King of the Sea, spent many days and weeks traveling with me on the beach volleyball circuit. Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, New York. You&#x2019;d be amazed where you can build a beach. He did it because he loved me, and because with Laird there is no halfway. He was in, even when it meant being called Mr. Reece.<br> <br>The whole scene was awkward. Even though I was a bigger deal celebritywise, and even though my success dominated the relationship, his personality dominated mine. This may come as a surprise to those people who may recall that I held the WBVL&#x2019;s record for most kills four years running, or that I was named the Offensive Player of the Year the summer before that fateful day on the north shore of Maui where I met and fell for Laird. We&#x2019;ve never been one of those modern, hip couples where it&#x2019;s been clear from the first kiss that he&#x2019;ll be fine hanging at home supporting her career by doing the laundry and planning the meals and she&#x2019;ll be out in the world hammering it down and supporting the family.<br> <br>By Christmas of 2000 I was done. The marriage had broken down, and I didn&#x2019;t feel like fixing it. Part of me had withdrawn. I thought: Who needs this shit? When I was young my motto was &#x201c;nothing and no one is above my own survival,&#x201d; and after four years my marriage to Laird was threatening my sense of myself. I was downplaying my independence, my sense of humor, my competence, my celebrity (such as it was) in order to be with him. Every day I was consciously trying to make everything about me smaller to minimize the friction in our relationship.<br> <br>So I filed for divorce.<br> <br>For a while, Laird tried to talk me out of it, but then he let me go.<br> <br>Then as now, we spent half the year in California, and half the year in Hawaii. When I called it quits Laird was in Kaua&#x2019;i and I was in Malibu. He packed up every last thing of mine in the Hawaii house and stuck it in storage. You can imagine what a good time this was for him&#x2014;he who plunges into one of his moods if he can&#x2019;t get out of the house and into the ocean by 7:30 a.m.&#x2014;spending days shoving the T-shirts, panties, and notebooks of the chick he still wanted into cardboard cartons, taping them shut, lugging them out to the car.<br> <br>I attempted to &#x201c;move on&#x201d;&#x2014;one of those phrases that we all use without being a hundred percent sure what it means or how you do it&#x2014;and threw myself into my work, a time-honored coping mechanism. The days were all right, but every morning I awoke with an ache in my gut. It felt as if one of those rawhide bones that dogs love to chew was sitting in my stomach.<br> <br>Then, in the spring, Laird passed through California, and arrived at the house in Malibu to pick up his snowboard. One of the paradoxical things about Laird is that even though he&#x2019;s a great-looking guy, he&#x2019;s not a flirt (actually, maybe he&#x2019;s not a flirt because he is good-looking; he doesn&#x2019;t need to do anything to gain attention once he&#x2019;s entered the room).He&#x2019;d completely disengaged from me. He was all business.<br> <br>I saw clearly at that moment that he&#x2019;d always been a generous, loving partner, and that his love had been a gift. He&#x2019;d withdrawn it, and now I was just some chick who was holding on to his snowboard. It was then, after he&#x2019;d fully stepped away, that I was able to look at him and see what I would be missing. For the first time I realized that he was a person with whom I had a good shot at happiness.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>There are thousands of people out there with ideas about how to be happy and happily married and live the dream and own the happily ever after (which you already know I have no aptitude for, having messed up my marriage almost instantly).<br> <br>A lot of them are men without children, or loners, or people who have other people to do the tedious shit that drives everyone who has to do it&#x2014;and who isn&#x2019;t a complete Zen master&#x2014;insane. Does Eckhart Tolle go to Costco every week for his family to make sure they have plenty of frozen three-berry mix for their smoothies and Pirate&#x2019;s Booty for healthy snacking? Does Deepak Chopra spend most of his waking hours washing towels that his family dropped on the bathroom floor and then trampled with their muddy feet? Gandhi was out there starving by himself, changing the world for the better, but let&#x2019;s not forget, Mrs. Gandhi was at home with the kids. What I&#x2019;m saying is that it&#x2019;s easy to be your best self when you don&#x2019;t live in the world of &#x201c;Clear your plate,&#x201d; &#x201c;Stop whining and go to bed,&#x201d; &#x201c;Did you brush your teeth?&#x201d; &#x201c;Honey, have you seen my clean shirt?&#x201d; &#x201c;Honey, what&#x2019;s for dinner?&#x201d; &#x201c;Honey, we haven&#x2019;t had sex in a month.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not beating up on these guys. They&#x2019;ve offered a lot of wisdom, advice, solace, and inspiration to thousands, if not millions of people. They are not, however, married to a guy who doesn&#x2019;t do email.<br> <br>I am.<br> <br>Laird and I got back together. For another year or two, we circled each other, unsure. We were like survivors of some natural disaster, grateful to be alive, but dazed by the wreckage. The foundation was cracked, the roof had leaks, the windows were smashed out. Repairs always take longer&#x2014;and cost more&#x2014;than you might first imagine.<br> <br>When we met, Laird was already respected in the world of surfing. As time went on, his star began to rise in the world at large. In 2004, he executive produced and starred in Riding Giants, and then a few years later he appeared in a big American Express campaign. He got to show the world that he wasn&#x2019;t just some guy who wandered around in swim trunks and flip-flops calling everyone Dude. (Which he never does, by the way.) This cultural stamp of approval helped to even out our personal playing field. I felt more comfortable because he was no longer simply Mr. Reece, trailing around behind me, carrying my gym bag from tournament to magazine shoot and home again. It wasn&#x2019;t as if the worldly success meant a lot to him personally, but it allowed us both to feel as if we were now on equal footing, careerwise. A friend once reminded me that small changes can result in making the big picture a whole lot better, and that&#x2019;s what happened to us.<br> <br>As I write this, we&#x2019;ve been married sixteen by-and-large happy years. In celebrity years, this translates to about nine million. It hasn&#x2019;t been perfect. The degree to which it&#x2019;s been imperfect would shock even those people who claim to thrive on imperfection. We had first one kid, then another. In 2007, we weathered another rough patch, and almost called it quits again. Through it all, I reminded myself of Anne Morrow Lindbergh&#x2019;s wisdom. At times, I&#x2019;ve been on the verge of tattooing it up one leg and down the other. Instead, I just committed it to memory:<br> <br>When you love someone, you do not love them all the time, in exactly the same way, from moment to moment. It is an impossibility. It is even a lie to pretend to. And yet this is exactly what most of us demand. We have so little faith in the ebb and flow of life, of love, of relationships. We leap at the flow of the tide and resist in terror its ebb. We are afraid it will never return. We insist on permanency, on duration, on continuity; when the only continuity possible, in life as in love, is in growth, in fluidity&#x2014;in freedom, in the sense that the dancers are free, barely touching as they pass, but partners in the same pattern.<br> <br>Partners in the same pattern. That&#x2019;s a better thing to aspire to than happily ever after. In all those fairy tales, and also in a lot of Hollywood movies you wind up Netflixing, the story ends at the happily ever after. It&#x2019;s pure bullshit. Nothing makes you superficially more happy than the first flushes of love, but in the ever after it&#x2019;s all about dealing with your lover, with understanding what makes him tick, surviving his crappy moods, and working together, always, to preserve what you&#x2019;ve got and nurture a deeper, more profound and grounded love into the future. Happily schmappily. I don&#x2019;t think so.<br> <br>From a dramatic perspective, this also means there&#x2019;s nothing left to tell. The good part of the tale has already been told. If we&#x2019;re lucky, we&#x2019;re married fifty or sixty years. Do you want to sign up for that? Half a century or more of no conflict, no drama, no restlessness, no opportunity to grow and change? You don&#x2019;t want that, do you? Rather than happily ever after, we should aspire to game on&#x2014;in part because that&#x2019;s the reality and in part because it&#x2019;s much more interesting.</p><h2>Mulch Ado about Murder (Local Foods Mystery)</h2><p><i>It&#x2019;s been a hot, dry spring in Westbury, Massachusetts.

The area beckoned to daring frontiersmen who produced the first major industry of the American West--the colorful but challenging, often dangerous fur trade. At the lead was an enterprising French Creole family that founded the city of St. Louis in 1763 and pushed forth to garner furs for world markets.</p><p>Stan Hoig provides an intimate look into the lives of four generations of the Chouteau family as they voyaged up the Western rivers to conduct trade, at times taking wives among the native tribes. They provided valuable aid to the Lewis and Clark expedition and assisted government officials in developing Indian treaties. National leaders, tribal heads, and men of frontier fame sought their counsel. In establishing their network of trading posts and opening trade routes throughout the Central Plains and Rocky Mountains, the Chouteaus contributed enormously to the nation's westward movement.</p></p><p>The story of the family that founded St. Louis and contributed to opening the West to American expansion.Stan Hoig is professor emeritus of journalism, University of Central Oklahoma, Edmond.

After an absence of more than 20 years, Leo Martindale returns to his ancestral estate, Longford Hall, to claim his inheritance, only to find that his sister and her husband have converted his home to a country hotel. Two days later, Martindale is found dead in a snow-covered ditch, apparently a hit-and-run victim. Clues suggesting murder lead Inspector Thanet to the Longford estate, where he compiles a list of suspects, all with reason for wishing Martindale dead, and, more importantly, all with opportunity to kill him. While struggling with a web of dark, twisting secrets, Thanet must cope simultaneously with his teenaged daughter Bridget and with his new superior. Skillfully plotted, replete with vivid characters, this mystery is a page turner to the end. Yet once more it's the likable and humane Inspector, and the glimpse into his family life, that gives the novel its rewarding texture. Simpson gets better and better.

It was the last live music broadcast from Warsaw: That day, a German bomb hit the station, and Polish Radio went off the air. Though he lost his entire family, Szpilman survived in hiding. In the end, his life was saved by a German officer who heard him play the same Chopin Nocturne on a piano found among the rubble. Written immediately after the war and suppressed for decades, THE PIANIST is a stunning testament to human endurance and the redemptive power of fellow feeling. &#39;The images drawn are unusually sharp and clear...but its moral tone is even more striking: Szpilman refuses to make a hero or a demon out of anyone&#39; LITERARY REVIEW</p><p>Written immediately after the end of World War II, this morally complex Holocaust memoir is notable for its exact depiction of the grim details of life in Warsaw under the Nazi occupation. "Things you hardly noticed before took on enormous significance: a comfortable, solid armchair, the soothing look of a white-tiled stove," writes Wladyslaw Szpilman, a pianist for Polish radio when the Germans invaded. His mother's insistence on laying the table with clean linen for their midday meal, even as conditions for Jews worsened daily, makes palpable the Holocaust's abstract horror. Arbitrarily removed from the transport that took his family to certain death, Szpilman does not deny the "animal fear" that led him to seize this chance for escape, nor does he cheapen his emotions by belaboring them. Yet his cool prose contains plenty of biting rage, mostly buried in scathing asides (a Jewish doctor spared consignment to "the most wonderful of all gas chambers," for example). Szpilman found compassion in unlikely people, including a German officer who brought food and warm clothing to his hiding place during the war's last days. Extracts from the officer's wartime diary (added to this new edition), with their expressions of outrage at his fellow soldiers' behavior, remind us to be wary of general condemnation of any group. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"[Szpilman's] account is hair-raising beyond anything Hollywood could invent...an altogether unforgettable book." -- <i>THE DAILY TELEGRAPH </i><p> "[Szpilman's] shock and ensuing numbness become ours, so that acts of ordinary kindness or humanity take on an aura of miracle. --<i>THE OBSERVER </i></p><p> "Rarely has the sheer claustrophobia of living in the Warsaw Ghetto been so vividly conveyed as it is by Szpilman." --<i>THE INDEPENDENT </i></p></p><h2>Kazakhstan: Nomadic Routes from Caspian to Altai (Odyssey Illustrated Guides)</h2><p>Spectacular photography, rich historical background, and essential travel information are combined in this indispensable reference for the immense, diverse, remote region at the crossroads of Europe and Asia.

Emphasizing the animal's capabilities for survival, Marrin offers both anecdotal accounts of human/rat encounters and impressive statistics. Rats have occupied the Earth far longer than humans, and they compete prodigiously for the world's food supply, earning their reputation as major pests to humankind. On the other hand, they provide an important source of protein for the many humans who eat them worldwide. (Not a pleasing bit of information for readers who have loved them as pets.) The nine short chapters are set in a handsome slim book with striking black-and-white scratchboard illustrations and muted red framing on many pages. Marrin touches briefly on physical characteristics as he explains the veneration of rats in some cultures, attempts to eradicate them in others, and rats as both carriers of disease and valued subjects of medical research. It's a different sort of discussion and format for this well-known historian and biographer and one that he has clearly enjoyed, as will a wide variety of nonfiction readers and animal fans.

Tolkien, reset and reissued in B format . In nearly 40 years since Tolkien&#39;s death in September 1973, millions have read The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion and become fascinated about the very private man behind the books. Born in Bloemfontein in January 1892, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was orphaned in childhood, brought up in near-poverty and almost thwarted in adolescent romance. He served in the First World War, surviving the Battle of the Somme, where he lost some of his closest friends, and returned to academic life, achieving high repute as a scholar and university teacher, eventually becoming Merton Professor of English at Oxford. Then suddenly his life changed dramatically. One day while marking essay papers he found himself writing &#39;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit&#39; -- and worldwide renown awaited him. Humphrey Carpenter was given unrestricted access to all Tolkien&#39;s papers, and interviewed his friends and family. From these sources he follows the long and painful process of creation that produced The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion and offers a wealth of information about the life and work of the twentieth century&#39;s most cherished author.</p><p>There may be a corner of the world where the name J.R.R. Tolkien is unknown, but you would be hard-pressed to find it. Since their publication, <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> have been published in every major language of the world. And though he single-handedly gave a mythology to the English and was beloved by millions, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien remained refreshingly unchanged by his fame and fortune, living out his days simply and modestly among the familiar surroundings of Oxford College. Humphrey Carpenter, who was given unrestricted access to Tolkien's papers, brilliantly puts meat to the bones of the Tolkien legend in <i>J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography</i>, offering a well-rounded portrayal of this quiet, bookish man who always saw himself first and foremost as a philologist, uncovering rather than creating the peoples, languages, and adventures of Middle-Earth.<p> Carpenter chronicles Tolkien's early life with a special sensitivity; after losing both parents, Tolkien and his brother Hilary were taken from their idyllic life in the English countryside to a poverty-ridden existence in dark and sooty Birmingham. There were bright points, however. A social and cheerful lad, Tolkien enjoyed rugby and was proud of his gift for languages. It was also at this time that he met Edith Bratt, who would later become his wife. Academic life--both as a student and professor--is where this biography shines. Friendship with other men played a huge part in Tolkien's life, and Carpenter deftly reveals the importance these relationships--his complex friendship with C.S. Lewis, membership in the Inklings and the T.C.B.S.--had on the development of his writing.</p><p> The only criticism one can make about this book is that Carpenter tends to gloss over Tolkien's contributions to comparative philology. True, there is a chapter devoted to Tolkien's academic pursuits, but it tends to skim too lightly over the surface for this reviewer's tastes. Philology is a terribly methodical science, and the author clearly did not want to alienate readers who were primarily interested in Tolkien as a storyteller. Still, it would be nice to understand why Tolkien was held in such high esteem by his fellow academics. As it stands, Tolkien comes off as a slightly eccentric etymologist.</p><p> Fans who want to delve even deeper into Tolkien's life should pick up a copy of Carpenter's <i>The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien</i>. <i>--P.M. Atterberry</i></p>Humphrey Carpenter was born in Oxford in 1946 and has spent most of his life in that city. He read English Language and Literature at Keble College, Oxford, and met Professor J.R.R. Tolkien on a number of occasions. For some years he worked for the BBC as a radio producer and broadcaster and won acclaim as a top biographer, including books on W.H.Auden, Evelyn Waugh, Robert Runcie and Spike Milligan.

It is the dismissal of the elderly as drains on the healthcare system. <p></p>The idea that human life is intrinsically valuable is dying side by side with our Christian culture, says author and intellectual historian Richard Weikart.

The founder of The Joshua Foundation, an organization dedicated to making Jesus better known throughout the world, he lives in Albany, New York.1<br><br>Herod, the Mad King<br><br>It is necessary to understand the type of life people lived in Jesus' day before we even begin to study Jesus' life and the situations and conditions that affected his outlook and reactions to various peoples he would encounter. The territories of Galilee, Samaria, Judea, and Idumea made up the land of the Israelites. In the time of David the land extended as far as Damascus, and into other lands across the Jordan River. Under David's reign there was only one kingdom. Shortly after his death, the kingdom was divided into the kingdom of Israel, which included Galilee and Samaria, and the kingdom of Judea. In the time just before the birth of Jesus, however, the situation was further confused by being broken up into various jurisdictions. A very wealthy and powerfully connected Idumean, who contributed supplies and money to the Roman generals needing local support, managed to convince the Roman emperor to install one of his sons as governor of Galilee. The son was Herod, one of the most brilliant, but also one of the most ruthless, rulers of his time.<br><br>After losing his governorship because of his cruelty, Herod schemed to get back into the good graces of Rome. Eventually, he won the support of the Roman general Mark Antony, who convinced the emperor Octavian to persuade the Roman senate to confirm Herod as king of Judea.<br><br>After the decree was issued making Herod king of Judea, he went to Judea to take over his kingdom. Judea was a thin strip of land that extended from Jericho and the Dead Sea, north to Mount Hermon, which is in present-day Lebanon. It also included Lake Huleh, the cold--water lake that fed the Jordan River, which extends all the way south to the Dead Sea.<br><br>The northern part of the kingdom called Galilee was rich in farmland and fruit and olive orchards, and produced wheat and barley and other grains. There were also extensive forests that provided lumber for construction. Herod took personal possession of all this land and its resources and rented it out to the inhabitants, from whom he collected high rents. It did not take long before Herod became a very wealthy king. He also benefited from the mines, principally the copper mines, in southern Judea. Shortly after becoming king, he undertook the construction of a vast network of buildings: palaces, fortifications, public baths after the style in Rome, and monuments to the Roman emperors, including vast amphitheaters for plays and other dramatic shows that rivaled in grandeur and splendor the impressive buildings in Rome itself.<br><br>As great a genius as Herod was in many ways, he also suffered from a pathological insecurity. Suspecting that others were plotting against him, he had hundreds of people executed on the slightest suspicions. To his Jewish subjects, he did the unthinkable when he dispossessed the high priestly family of their sacred positions and appointed as chief priests his own friends from Idumea, men who were not even priests, much less Israelites. He also eliminated the wealthy and highly influential Sadducees from their positions as members of the Sanhedrin, who ruled Jerusalem. He promoted the Sadducees' bitter enemies, the Pharisees, to fill the vacancies, inflaming a political rivalry among them that would last for decades. The Sadducees were well educated, mostly by Greek teachers who instilled in their students a deep love of Greek culture and pagan philosophy. The Pharisees, on the other hand, were totally dedicated to preserving the religious laws and customs and traditions of their ancestors. The bitter animosity between these two groups would last until the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 a.d. One of the few times they were to become allies was when they needed each other's help to destroy Jesus. Even their best and sharpest minds could not outwit Jesus' by themselves.<br><br>Herod kept control of his kingdom by keeping his enemies in constant conflict with one another. His own family, however, was to become his undoing. He was insanely suspicious of everyone, and powerful members of his family could exploit that flaw for their own advantage. His ten wives were a constant cause of trouble, each one hoping that her offspring would be heir to his wealth and power. His Jewish-born wife, Mariamne, together with her mother, overstepped her bounds when they schemed to have Mariamne's brother made high priest. He was at least a Jew and not a pagan. A short time later the brother was drowned in a family pool, without doubt under Herod's orders. Then, Mariamne's grandfather, who had previously been in power, was assassinated. And finally, Herod had his beloved Mariamne put to death, which he much regretted afterward.<br><br>Intrigue in Herod's family never stopped. His wives were continually scheming, poisoning Herod's mind against one another's sons. It is hard to count the number of family members Herod had murdered to protect his throne. By the time Jesus was born, he had killed off practically every potential heir to his kingdom. After the assassination of Antipater, his son by his first wife, a Jewess, Emperor Octavian made the remark, "It is better to be one of Herod's pigs than one of his sons."<br><br>As Herod grew older he became more prey than ever to suspicions fostered intentionally by his own inner family circle, whose plotting never ended. It took its toll on him, as he was rapidly deteriorating mentally as well as physically.<br><br>By the time rumors began to surface that the coming of the long--awaited Messiah was imminent, he was totally consumed with fear of plots on his life and on his throne. The insane king was in no mood to deal with an avenging king the Judeans had been expecting for almost two thousand years.<br>2<br><br>The Messiah Has Arrived<br><br>It had been prophesied that Yahweh's anointed Savior would be born in Bethlehem, in Judea. In exile Daniel had prophesied, though in a veiled way, that he would be born 490 years from the ending of the Babylonian exile, which was quite accurate. (Dn. 9:24) He would also be a descendant of King David. He would be born of a virgin, as interpreted by Hebrew scholars. (Is. 7:14) His name would be Emmanuel, "God living among us." He would be called Prince of Peace, Wonder--Counselor, and Father-of-the-World-to-Come, among other epic titles. (Is. 9:5) He would also destroy Israel's enemies, establish a reign that would last for a thousand years, and extend Israel's power and influence throughout the whole world, fulfilling Yahweh's ancient promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations.<br><br>And this is how it began. One day, according to Saint Luke's Gospel,<br><br>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, who was from the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary. When the angel appeared, he greeted her with the words, "Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women." When she noticed his presence, she was troubled by his words, and wondered at the meaning of such a greeting.<br><br>The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God. And, listen to what I tell you. You are to conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus. He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he shall be king over the house of Jacob forever. His kingdom will be forever."<br><br>Mary said to the angel, "How will this happen since I do not know man?"<br><br>The angel said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, and the Holy One to be born of you will be called the Son of God. And, listen to this, Elizabeth, your kinswoman, also has conceived a son in her old age, and she who was considered sterile is now in her sixth month, for nothing is impossible to God." (Lk. 1:26-37)<br><br>This mentioning of the Holy Spirit is a new revelation involving the nature of God. It is the first time the Holy Spirit is mentioned in Scripture as a person. Mary, who told this to Luke, certainly could not have invented this new concept involving the nature of God. She merely related to Luke what she had experienced at the angel's visit.<br><br>Mary said to the angel, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word." And the angel departed from her. (Lk. 1:38)<br><br>Saint Augustine said in commenting on this event that the salvation of the human race hung on Mary's consent to God's proposal. There is an extraordinary delicacy on the part of God in sending the angel, and not just an angel, but an archangel. The mission of the angel was to propose to Mary, and ask if she would consent to become the mother of God's Son. That is stunning. It also manifests the sensitivity of God toward the free will He has given to us. Adam and Eve were given free will so they could freely choose to love God. They chose their own independence instead. And their descendants waited for millions of years for God to give us another chance. Now Mary was asked to make another decision that would also affect the destiny of the human race. She was asked if she would consent to become the mother of the Savior, to be the vehicle of our salvation. Fortunately for us her response was "yes," and thus we were given another chance. In becoming the mother of God's Son, she became our mother also, since we are the adopted brothers and sisters of Jesus, who shares his life with us in baptism. We are her children not by a mere adoption but because we have Jesus' life within us. In saying "yes" to God, and consenting to bring our Savior into the world, she has given us a gift for which we could never possibly express adequate gratitude. The awesome greeting of the archangel expressed the lofty position to which God raised this humble young girl.

Here are his boyhood experiences of reading books and his first youthful efforts at writing them; the early glimmers and the evolution of ideas about the proper relation of particular literary forms to particular cultures and identities. Here, too, is Naipaul&#x2019;s famous comment on his putative literary forebear Conrad, and a less familiar but no less intriguing preface to the only book Naipaul&#x2019;s father ever published. Finally, in his celebrated Nobel Lecture, &#x201c;Two Worlds,&#x201d; Naipaul reflects on the full scope of his career, rounding off the volume as an intellectual autobiography. Sustained by extraordinary powers of expression and thought, <i>Literary Occasions</i> is a stirring contribution to the fading art of the critic, and a revelation as well of a life in letters, in its many exemplary instances.</p><p><b>Praise for V.

Once an artist&#x2019;s model, now a mother, Rathburn knows &#x201c;how hard / it is to be held in the eyes of another.&#x201d; Intimate and fearless, her poems move in interlocking sections between the pleasures and dangers of childhood, between masterpieces of art and magazine centerfolds, and&#x2015;in a gripping sequence in dialogue with Delacroix&#x2019;s paintings and sketches of Medea&#x2015;between the twinned ferocities of maternal love and rage. With singular vision and potent poetic form, Rathburn crafts a complex portrait of girlhood and motherhood from which it is impossible to look away.</p><p>"In <i>Still Life with Mother and Knife</i>, Chelsea Rathburn tells us that we inhabit our own fairy tales, and we have to learn to walk alone in the woods--the briary forests of adolescence, the dark drifts of motherhood, and then the lonely sands of old age.

A book on modern architecture without Shulman is inconceivable. Some of his architectural photographs, like the iconic shots of Frank Lloyd Wright&#39;s or Pierre Koenig&#39;s remarkable structures, have been published countless times. The brilliance of buildings like those by Charles Eames, as well as those of his close Friend, Richard Neutra, was first brought to light by Shulman&#39;s photography. The clarity of his work demanded that architectural photography had to be considered as an independent art form. Each Schulman image unites perception and understanding for the buildings and their place in the landscape. The precise compositions reveal not just the architectural ideas behind a building&#39;s surface, but also the visions and hopes of an entire age. A sense of humanity is always present in his work, even when the human figure is absent from the actual photographs. Today, a great many of the buildings documented by Shulman have disappeared or been crudely converted, but the thirst for his pioneering images is stronger than ever before. This is a vivid journey across six decades of great architecture and classic photography through the famously incomparable eyes of Julius Shulman.</p><p>Our contact with great architecture tends to be indirect, through representations. Few of us have seen the Taj Mahal, yet we all know exactly what it looks like. The useful act of photographing buildings can be an art, particularly when the photographer's presence seems to recede, and a great architectural shot suggests that you're seeing things as they are rather than through someone else's prism.<p> Julius Shulman has documented buildings in that seemingly transparent way for more than six decades. This meticulous and prolific craftsman was in the right place, California, at the right time, the golden age of West Coast modern residential architecture that spanned the 1930s to the 1960s. Richard Neutra helped him get his start, and he recorded early modernists such as Wright, Schindler, Soriano, Harris, Frey, Ain, Stone, Gropius, Kahn, and Neutra, as well as younger ones such as Goff, Lautner, Ellwood, Koenig, Drake, Killingsworth, Eames, Greene, Legoretta, and even early Frank Gehry. His view camera captured the glamour of hillside steel-and-glass houses cantilevered above the city lights, the serenity of desert vacation homes at dusk, and the clean-lined ingenuity of young architects working on modest budgets.</p><p> Shulman's text is a knotty quasi biography, but some good stories lurk there. This is a physically impressive book: its 300 large-format pages contain 500 superbly reproduced color and black-and-white photos that are worth more than the proverbial thousand words each. <i>--John Pastier</i></p></p><h2>Constantine the Great General: A Military Biography</h2><p>Constantine the Great is a titanic figure in Roman, and indeed world history. Most famed for making Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire (and thus ensuring its survival and spread), and for moving the seat of imperial rule to 'New Rome' (Constantinople), he is most often studied for his religious and political impact. But it is often forgotten that his power and success was made possible by the use of armed force, in an impressive military career which is well worthy of study in its own right. Constantine won victories over external barbarian armies as well as defeating the Roman armies of his internal rivals in civil war.<br><br>Elizabeth James sets the scene with a discussion of the nature of the Roman army as it emerged and evolved from from the Third Century Crisis, describing the make up of the armies, their weapons and tactics, and the impact of Constantine's policies and reforms. She then examines each of Constantine's campaigns and battles, (including the British campaign which led to his proclamation as emperor at York) to show that he deserves to be remembered as a great general as well as a great emperor. This will be a welcome study of a neglected facet of this historical colossus.</p><p>Dr Stephen English was recently awarded his PhD for his thesis on the military career of Alexander the Great. His first book, The Army of Alexander the Great, was published by Pen &amp; Sword in 2009. He lives in County Durham.<br><br>Elizabeth James studied Ancient History at Oxford and Durham Universities, where a good knowledge of Greek and Latin allowed her to work on the sources in their original form. She has a particular interest in Late Antiquity. After a brief career in teaching, she is now a pursuing a career as a professional author and copy-editor. She has recently completed writing an A-level course on Classical Civilization for Oxford College.Constantine&#39;s life and reign were accompanied by significant military activity - Elizabeth James turns a focused lens on the under-reviewed marital aspect of this ruler - The text itself is well - written and highly accessible - The transitions are effected smoothly. The chapters of this section are intended jointly as a foundation for understanding the forces which shaped Constantine, and especially his relationship to the military. In this, they work reasonably well, especially for the reader who wants only a brief introduction to these topics - well formulated, accessible text, &#34;Consantine the Great: Warlord of Rome&#34; provides general readers with a quick overview of Constantine&#39;s role as a military commander - the book remains worth reading for those seeking an introduction to the topic or wanting to expand this picture of this emperor.&#39; Ancient Warfare</p><h2>Viking Tales</h2><p>ABOUT THE BOOK:- Beautiful short tales, simple enough for children but for adult too.

Their forays out of mother land Norway resulted in settlements in Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, France. An extremely well written book. The short sentences yet contiguous with the next have simplicity and straightforwardness as its style. Very refreshing indeed. This is a good introduction to Viking lore.

Some friends thrilled to see themselves in the comic, others not so much, but everyone was interested. <br> <br> <i>Awkward</i> chronicles Ariel's freshman year, and <i>Definition,</i> her sophomore year. With anxiety in excess and frustration to the fullest, Ariel dives in -- meeting new people, going to concerts, crushing out, loving chemistry, drawing comics, and obsessing over everything from glitter-laden girls to ionic charges and the constant pursuit of the number-one score. <br> <br> Totally true and achingly honest, with every cringe-inducing encounter and exhilarating first moment documented -- <i>Awkward and Definition</i> is an unflinching look at what it's like being a teenage girl in America.</p><p><b>Ariel Schrag</b> is also the author of the autobiographical comic books <i>Potential,</i> which was nominated for an Eisner Award, and <i>Likewise.</i> She divides her time between Los Angeles and New York.Many memoirs both inside and outside the world of comics cover the author's high school years. Far fewer are actually written during those years. Touchstone has started reprinting Schrag's comics chronicling her teenage years through the mid-'90s. Each of the volumes in Schrag's series was created in the summer of the year it chronicles. This book includes <i>Awkward</i>, about Schrag's freshman year, and <i>Definition</i>, which concerns her sophomore year. It's hard not to notice that the books were written and drawn by a young artist. The artwork is simple and, yes, awkward, especially in <i>Awkward</i>, where the characters look like punk versions of the Peanuts cast. But rather than being a drawback, the artwork is actually charming. It's clear that Schrag is pushing herself. Even at this age, she had already attained the ability to keep the storytelling smooth and fast-paced, even if the stories she's actually telling aren't remarkable. The typical teenage concerns of sex, drugs, drama with friends and the importance of music are all covered. The book is comfortable because it's so easy to relate to. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At a time when railroads still relied on steam power for most service and diesels remained a novelty, Electro-Motive took the nation by storm with its distinctive-looking four-motor F-unit locomotives that echoed across America. The F unit soon became the standard diesel on many American railroads for over two decades.This book covers the F from its humble beginnings, to a time when virtually every railroad operated F units, and beyond. This book displays the F unit's distinctive livery in just about every setting across the American landscape with over 300 rare photographs. Feel the power of the 567 engine as you learn about their specifications in detail. Read about the challenges faced by this phenomenon in freight and passenger service, how they were overcome, and why the F unit is still regarded as one of the most fascinating locomotives in railroading.

That&#39;s the maxim of Olympus, the utopian city that sprung from the ashes of World War III. But Deunan and Bri, a young woman and her cyborg companion just entering the rose-tinted society, find that so long as there are different kinds of people there will be differences among them. Such is the story of Appleseed, the masterwork of manga storyteller Masamune Shirow. Beautiful art and a complex and fully realized future world rank this title among the best comics available.</p><p>Even if Masamune Shirow is more widely known for creating <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>, it is for his magnum opus <i>Appleseed</i> that he became known as a master comics storyteller. And it's easy to see why. The fiction world that <i>Appleseed</i> takes place in--a near-future, post-WWIII utopia--is exquisitely crafted and detailed. Into this new utopia come Deunan Knute, a nomad street-smart soldier, and her cyborg partner, Briareos. This book moves at a leisurely pace as we are introduced to the characters and their new home on the island of Olympus. But once the stage is set and the pieces are in place, an action scene erupts that carries through the rest of the book. From here the central thematic conflict of the series is established: the human race's two options of (1) pursuing their every desire, thereby dragging their whole world into destruction, or (2) changing their very nature to preserve the present sterile utopia forever. This is essential reading for anyone interested in science fiction.</p><h2>Sex and the Seasoned Woman</h2><p>A seasoned woman is spicy. She has been marinated in life experience. . . .

Sex and the Seasoned Woman is the story of an intimate revolution taking place under our very noses. <br>Boomer generation women in midlife are open to sex, love, dating, new dreams, exploring spirituality, and revitalizing their marriages as never before. This is a new universe of passionate, liberated women&#x2013;married and single&#x2013;who are unwilling to settle for the stereotypical roles of middle age and are now realizing they don&#x2019;t have to. As life spans grow longer and as societal constraints continue to loosen, older women&#x2013;once free of the exhausting demands of young children, needy husbands, and demanding careers&#x2013;find themselves ready to pursue the passionate life. They embrace their &#x201c;second adulthood&#x201d; as a period of reawakening.<br>Written in Sheehy&#x2019;s singularly compelling style, combining interviews and research, this book gives voice to more than a hundred fascinating and colorful women. The inspiring stories tell of wives who reinvigorate their marriages after their children leave the nest as well as divorced, widowed, and long-single women who find new dreams and new loves. Sheehy delineates a crucial link between cultivating a new dream and reopening the pathway to intimacy and sexual pleasure. She also examines the latest medical breakthroughs addressing symptoms that have unnecessarily curtailed women&#x2019;s sex lives.<br>From women who find their sexuality reawakened by a younger lover, to couples whose marriages survive health crises and grow stronger, to women who finally find a soulmate in their sixties, to stories from seasoned sirens in their seventies, eighties, and even nineties, these portraits cover an enormous range of experience. In them, Sheehy locates the universal patterns that enable us all to recognize and understand our own lives.</p><p>Bestselling author and cultural observer Gail Sheehy made history with the publication of Passages, which was an international bestseller, appearing in twenty-eight languages.

A popular entertainer who was seated at the next table overheard me talking with my husband about my book. She leaned over to ask what it would be about. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about sex, love, and dating among women over fifty,&#x201d; I blurted out.<br><br> The entertainer&#x2019;s dinner companion rolled her eyes: &#x201c;She&#x2019;s the poster girl for dating and sex after fifty!&#x201d;<br><br> The entertainer, whom we&#x2019;ll call Bebe to protect her anonymity, was eager to elaborate. Bebe had been raised in the South with parents who were in love until the day they died. She had fully expected that she, like they, would marry for life. And happily, she had enjoyed an extended sexual honeymoon with the man she married in her twenties. It was in her forties that Bebe began to notice the cracks in their marriage. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s like you see a hairline crack in the wall in your California house and you say, &#x2018;Not to worry.&#x2019; A couple of years later, you notice the crack is now a quarter inch wide&#x2014;don&#x2019;t panic, it&#x2019;s a plaster thing. Then one big shake and the whole house tumbles down and you say, &#x2018;Wow, how did that happen?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> In retrospect, she understands. Her frustration with her marriage was an echo of the complaint that fortyish husbands used before feminism went mainstream: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve grown and, unfortunately, she hasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; In Bebe&#x2019;s marriage, as in many more today, it was the husband who resisted taking risks to grow. It took her five years to get up the courage to ask for a divorce. She took that final step a few months before her fiftieth birthday.<br><br> &#x201c;You must be crazy,&#x201d; she told herself. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to spend the rest of your life home alone watching reruns of The Brady Bunch.&#x201d; But it wasn&#x2019;t like that at all. Quite the opposite, she says; it&#x2019;s been the greatest adventure of her life.<br><br> The sociologist in me cast about for a context into which to fit this revelation. In fact, even while Bebe was settled into staid married life, a new public square of midlife singles was being flooded with divorced and never-married women and men. All the old rules were up for renegotiation. What was it like out there? I prodded.<br><br> In the first couple of years after her divorce, Bebe said, she had felt shell-shocked. &#x201c;I went through a stage of mourning and learning to be alone. But people kept coming into my path. I met men at the airport, the grocery store, at church. Because once I started opening my eyes, there were really men everywhere. It wasn&#x2019;t like I was shopping, but they were flirting with me, talking to me, asking me out.&#x201d; Her therapist told her, &#x201c;You have a neon sign on your forehead that blares: Available.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Pretty young women with firm bodies scared me as long as I saw myself as having to compete with them,&#x201d; she explained. &#x201c;But what I found is I&#x2019;m not in the same pool as they are. The older men who are looking for twenty- or thirty-something hard bodies are not the men who would look at me to begin with. These are two different universes.&#x201d;<br><br> Bebe&#x2019;s first dating experience turned the usual calculations on their head. He was a young man she met in church&#x2014;and not just a little younger, fifteen years younger than she. &#x201c;I was flabbergasted,&#x201d; said Bebe. &#x201c;I was thinking, &#x2018;This gorgeous young man wants to go out with me?&#x2019; &#x201d; She bit the bullet and asked him, &#x201c;Do you really know how old I am?&#x201d; He said he didn&#x2019;t care. She told him anyway: fifty. He didn&#x2019;t seem fazed. He said she was smart and interesting and he just liked talking to her; he wanted to pursue it.<br><br> I asked Bebe if it was a revelation to her to have sex with somebody that young after living so many years with her husband. Her eyes danced and her voice jumped an octave.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, yeah! It was quite wonderful.&#x201d; Bebe quickly qualified her expectations. &#x201c;I never looked at him as somebody I was going to spend the rest of my life with. I don&#x2019;t think he looked at me in that way, either. For six months we enjoyed each other&#x2019;s company and had a lot of fun. I believe people come into your life for a reason. He was the one who came into my life to say, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s gonna be okay, you can do this.&#x2019; Getting over that hurdle was the big one.&#x201d;<br><br> Most of our grandmothers would find this a strange conversation. Half a century ago, there were certainly exceptional 50-year-old women who had lovers, and married people in their sixties and seventies who still enjoyed each other sexually. But it wasn&#x2019;t the norm. As the boundaries of our life span continue to expand in startling ways, the social definitions of age have shifted with the force of tectonic plates, altering just about everything.<br><br> Not all of us are as flashy as Bebe, nor do we all want to be, but I soon found that she is at the forefront of a trend. She is honest enough to admit that she misses some things about marriage. &#x201c;When it was going well, we had great companionship.&#x201d; But like most women over 50 who can afford to walk away from a relationship if it has become a safe but hollow shell, Bebe savors her independence. She may have a neon sign on her forehead blinking Available, but it doesn&#x2019;t advertise Looking for Husband. She is looking for fun, companionship, maybe intimacy, but definitely satisfying sex.<br><br> ���<br> Sex and the Seasoned Woman is a book about a new universe of lusty, liberated women, some married and some not, who are unwilling to settle for the stereotypical roles of middle age. We are rediscovering who we are, or who we&#x2019;d set out to be before we became wrapped up in the roles of our First Adulthood, when our primary focus was on nurturing children, husbands, or careers&#x2014;or all three.<br><br> Millions of women today have struggled through all the predictable crises of their Tryout Twenties, Turbulent Thirties, and Forlorn Forties, and are bursting out into a whole new territory. Men, as they approach their fifties and sixties and start feeling the push to retire, often get a little shaky, wondering, Who will I be once stripped of the robes and powers of my position in the workplace? Women have changed robes so many times, they&#x2019;re ready to strip down and start fresh, feeling a boost of independence, exhilaration about what could lie ahead, and a surge of new powers.<br><br> What makes a seasoned woman?<br><br> Time.<br><br> A seasoned woman is spicy. She has been marinated in life experience. Like a complex wine, she can be alternately sweet, tart, sparkling, mellow. She is both maternal and playful. Assured, alluring, and resourceful. She is less likely to have an agenda than a young woman&#x2014;no biological clock tick-tocking beside her lover&#x2019;s bed, no campaign to lead him to the altar, no rescue fantasies. The seasoned woman knows who she is. She could be any one of us, as long as she is committed to living fully and passionately in the second half of her life, despite failures and false starts.<br><br> Single boomer women like Bebe are not the only ones who are actively, even aggressively, seeking romance again, declaring their right to sexual satisfaction, and dreaming new dreams. Their boldness has caught on with &#x201c;ladies&#x201d; of earlier generations who were taught that their role was only to oblige their husbands and pick up after their children.<br><br> Margaret, an old friend and former radical who was still married to her only husband and living in rural New Hampshire, confided to me how shocked she was to hear stories from her contemporary female friends who are divorced or widowed in their sixties or seventies. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re having romantic escapades with young guys, they talk about erotic discoveries, a couple of them have fallen in love again, but they want relationships beyond conventional marriage.&#x201d; Margaret still thought of herself as the free spirit who had walked the wild side in the 1960s. &#x201c;I was the rebel, and they were the stick-in-the-muds. Now I&#x2019;m the old married fuddy-duddy.&#x201d;<br><br> But you do not have to break up your marriage to change your life. Long-married women are also waking up to the possibilities of postmenopausal sensuality and proposing new contracts to shake the staleness out of their relationships and release their deferred creative energies. I met a California couple in which the husband had given up a stressful career as an attorney to help his wife pursue her dream: opening her own bookstore. Life partners who help each other feed and grow their passions can enjoy the magnified rewards of a marriage revitalized in middle life.<br><br> Counting Backward<br><br> Just how old is a seasoned woman? I define it very much the way Auntie Mame&#x2019;s friend Vera did when asked, &#x201c;How old are you, anyway?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Somewhere between forty and death.&#x201d;<br><br> It&#x2019;s not over at 45 or 50, &#x201c;it&#x201d; being sex, intimacy, discovery of a new identity and a new passion in life. On the contrary, it begins all over again. Today, 50 is the start of a whole new cycle. You may have already lived an entire adulthood, but now you are at the beginning of another one&#x2014;a portion of the life span that I identified in 1995 as our Second Adulthood.<br><br> Women&#x2019;s lives are long and have many seasons. As contemporary women, if we&#x2019;re healthy, we will likely be around longer than our mothers were. As I first reported in New Passages, epidemiologists say that a woman who reaches the age of 50 free of cancer and heart disease can expect to...</p><h2>Tropical Pacific Invertebrates</h2><p>A field guide to the marine invertebrates occuring on tropical Pacific coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangroves.</p><p>Patrick L.

Page after page of rarely seen art reveals the labor involved in creating one of comics&#x2019; most acclaimed books.</p><p><b>Mike Mignola's</b> fascination with ghosts and monsters began at an early age; reading <i>Dracula</i> at age twelve introduced him to Victorian literature and folklore, from which he has never recovered. Starting in 1982 as a bad inker for Marvel Comics, he swiftly evolved into a not-so-bad artist. By the late 1980s, he had begun to develop his own unique graphic style, with mainstream projects like <i>Cosmic Odyssey</i> and <i>Batman: Gotham by Gaslight</i>. In 1994, he published the first <i>Hellboy</i> series through Dark Horse. There are thirteen <i>Hellboy</i> graphic novels (with more on the way), several spin-off titles (<i>B.P.R.D., Lobster Johnson, Abe Sapien, </i>and<i> Sir Edward Grey: Witchfinder</i>), prose books, animated films, and two live-action films starring Ron Perlman. Along the way he worked on Francis Ford Coppola's film <i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> (1992), was a production designer for Disney's<i> Atlantis: The Lost Empire</i> (2001), and was the visual consultant to director Guillermo del Toro on <i>Blade II</i> (2002), <i>Hellboy</i> (2004), and <i>Hellboy II: The Golden Army</i> (2008).

These linguistic fig leaves, as they have been called, range from delicate evasions (&#34;bosom&#34;, &#34;unmentionables&#34;, and &#34;the love that dare not speak its name&#34;) to monstrosities that are designed to disguise torture (&#34;energetic interrogation&#34;), sanitize war (&#34;soft ordnance&#34;, not &#34;napalm&#34;), and cover up mass murder (&#34;the Final Solution&#34; and &#34;ethnic cleansing&#34;). Completely cross-referenced and featuring a general introduction that tells how and why euphemisms are created, often in sequences as one term succeeds another, this dictionary is especially valuable for its detailed attention to the origins of expressions and for its many examples of actual usage, showing the interplay between language and culture.

Through numerous interviews with most of the principles involved and a mountain of painstaking research From Dublin To Jailbreak: Thin Lizzy 69 - 76 examines the band&#39;s career up to 1976 culminating in the superlative and sparkling Jailbreak, home of such hits as &#39;Cowboy Song&#39;, &#39;Emerald&#39;, &#39;Jailbreak&#39; and &#39;The Boys Are Back In Town&#39; and Johnny The Fox that included the hit single &#39;Don&#39;t Believe A Word&#39;. Along the way, alcohol and drugs wreaked havoc between band members, producers and managers, but despite line-up changes and a mostly grinding, rock scrabble existence, Ireland&#39;s favourite sons persevered, finally achieving the smash hit record they&#39;d deserved for so long. Immerse yourself in Popoff&#39;s celebrated record-by-record methodology and emerge a rejuvenated Lizzy fan, newly appreciative of the deep album tracks hiding within this singular band&#39;s often forgotten early years. Based on interviews the author conducted specifically for the book with band members Eric Bell, Scott Gorham, Brian Downey, Gary Moore and Brian Robertson; managers Terry O&#39;Neill and Ted Carroll; producers Nick Tauber and Ron Nevison; Nigel Grange from Vertigo; road manager Frank Murray and cover artist Jim Fitzpatrick, reveal Phil Lynott in all his dastardly guises and make From Dublin To Jailbreak: Thin Lizzy 69 - 76, an essential read for the devoted fans.</p><p>Canadian author Martin Popoff has written over twenty books on rock music and is one of the most respected authors within the genre.Popoff looks deep inside the band&#39;s ups-and-downs.

Original.</p><p>"Eleven years before another Charlie--Manson--told Americans to watch out for their homicidal children, [Charlie] Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate drove the message home with blades and bullets, stopping only when their car ran out of gas and they ran out of luck. If [James] Dean and [Marlon] Brando were the poster children for a generation run amok, then Starkweather and Fugate were the word made flesh. Their bloody trek across the heartland represents a turning point as grim and critical as Dallas or Kent State. It taught Americans to look for enemies around the breakfast table, rather than in Moscow or Havana."<p> Michael Newton, author of <i>Bad Girls Do It!</i> and other books about serial murder, combines an energetic prose style with extensive research to tell the tale of this famous 1958 pair of spree killers from Lincoln, Nebraska. Caril is a bit of a blank--just a sullen, peevish 14-year-old--but Charlie comes eerily alive in this book: his red hair, his slanted green eyes, his bowlegged strut, his resemblance to James Dean before he'd even seen Dean in a movie. He was the third child of seven in an outwardly normal family, but somehow he got a chip on his shoulder and thought the world had him "numbered for the bottom." <i>Waste Land</i> invites us into Charlie and Caril's world, then takes on a creepy, suspenseful ride through the eight days that left 11 people dead. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Michael Newton is the author of numerous fiction and nonfiction works, including <i>Waste Land, Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer,</i> and <i>Cat and Mouse</i>.

Is one country&#39;s sense of happiness the same as another&#39;s? In the last two decades, psychologists and economists have learned a lot about who&#39;s happy and who isn&#39;t. The Dutch are, the Romanians aren&#39;t, and Americans are somewhere in between...After years of going to the world&#39;s least happy countries, Eric Weiner, a veteran foreign correspondent, decided to travel and evaluate each country&#39;s different sense of happiness and discover the nation that seemed happiest of all.Eric Weiner discovers the relationship between money and happiness in tiny and extremely wealthy Qatar (and it&#39;s not a good one). He goes to Thailand, and finds that not thinking is a contented way of life. He goes to the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, and discovers they have an official policy of Gross National Happiness! He asks himself why the British don&#39;t do happiness? In Weiner&#39;s quest to find the world&#39;s happiest places, he eats rotten Icelandic shark, meditates in Bangalore, visits strip clubs in Bangkok and drinks himself into a stupor in Reykjavik. Full of inspired moments, &#34;The Geography of Bliss&#34; accomplishes a feat few travel books dare and even fewer achieve: to make you happier.</p><p>Eric Weiner, an award-winning foreign correspondent for NPR and a former reporter for the New York Times, has written stories from more than three dozen countries, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Indonesia. His commentary has appeared in The New Republic, The International Herald Tribune, and The Los Angeles Times, and he writes the popular &#34;How They Do It&#34; column for Slate. He has lived in New Delhi, Jerusalem and Tokyo.Foreign journalist Eric Weiner, tired of bearing so much bad news for National Public Radio, visits 10 nations around the world to learn what makes their citizens happy. He&#39;s an appealing narrator--clear voiced and good natured--and he can tell a good story. The understated chumminess in his voice is a perfect vehicle for his wry observations, well-disguised self-deprecation, and ultra-smooth writing skills. Weiner&#39;s stories and observations warm the heart but also deliver a satisfying supply of his abundant wit, big-city perspective, and generous appreciation of the human condition. More literary than scientific and free from any pretense of inspiration, this production offers time well spent with a nuanced thinker and a relaxing account of the large and small experiences that make people everywhere so interesting.

Only the Transcendent Pig knows, and it's not telling. . . .<br> But Nita Callahan needs to find out--and<i> soon</i>. Her wizardly partnership with Kit has fallen apart. Much worse, her mother has gotten sick . . . so sick she may never leave the hospital.<br> Only one person can help Nita--the One she's devoted her life to fighting.<br></p><p>The fifth title in Diane Duane's <i>Young Wizards</i> series delves deeper into an emotional landscape than any of her previous books (<i>So You Want to Be a Wizard</i>, <i>Deep Wizardry</i>, <i>High Wizardry</i>, and <i>A Wizard Abroad</i>). For the first time ever, friends and wizard partners Nita and Kit seem to be having trouble communicating. They argue over a spell to clean up the pollution in New York's Jones Inlet, and from that point on, they can't connect on anything. Is it adolescence that's tearing them apart or something more profound? Meanwhile, Nita and her family are stunned to discover that her mother has cancer, and there's a possibility that nothing--not surgery, not even wizardry--can fight it. Nita refuses to let her mom go down without a fight, however, and soon she's on a mission that brings her face-to-face with the Lone Power, source of all death in the universe--Nita's worst enemy, and possibly her only hope.<p> Impressive in its scope, <i>The Wizard's Dilemma</i>, like all the titles in Duane's series, is packed with an intriguing combination of technology and magic that fans of fantasy, science fiction, technology, and even Christian literature will find absolutely gripping. Nita is a complex character, as befits her status as a teenager, not to mention a wizard. Her confusion and self-doubt will be painfully believable to every reader. There are no simple answers in this remarkably philosophical novel.

World-class interpretations exist of its Classical and subsequent history, but there has been remarkably little holistic exploration of how its societies, culture and economies first came into being, despite the fact that almost all the fundamental developments originated well before 500 bc. This book is the first full, interpretive synthesis for a generation on the rise of the Mediterranean world from its beginning, before the emergence of our own species, up to the threshold of Classical times. Extensively illustrated and ranging across disciplines, subject matter and chronology from early humans and the origins of farming and metallurgy to the rise of civilizations Egyptian, Levantine, Hispanic, Minoan, Mycenaean, Phoenician, Etruscan, early Greek the book is a masterpiece of archaeological and historical writing.</p><p><p><b> A Look Inside: <em>The Making of the Middle Sea</em> [Click Images to Enlarge]</b></p> <i>The rock of Gibraltar</i> as it looks today and as it might have appeared during phases of lower sea level to the Neanderthals occupying large caverns along its base.

The Russian Orthodox inherited their apostolic faith from the Greek Fathers, a faith which grew and flourishes to this day. This book is replete with events, personalities and tragedies of unprecedented scale. The history of the Russian Church begins with the legalization of Christianity by Constantine and the development of the church-state &#39;symphony&#39;transplanted to the young Russian state through the adoption of Christianity from the Byzantines. Subsequent chapters lead the reader through nine centuries of the history of the Russians to the calamities of the twentieth century. The latter sections provide a detailed account of the almost miraculous survival of the Church during the turmoil of the Communist era. The book ends with a detailed survey of the post-Communist era and the critical role, position, status and policies of the Orthodox Church in that brief and telling period. The author has written for both the educated and the inquisitive. Those interested in theology, Russian studies, and the history of culture will profit from this book.</p><p>Dimitry Pospielovsky is Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Western Ontario.

They are the constant streams of obstacles thrown in the way of planning and the governor of progress. Armies encountered any number of unpredictable obstacles in any number of situations. Each friction requires a different solution. Each challenge is a diversion from the planned objective. Each unplanned task saps an army&#39;s resources needed elsewhere. Frictions steered the armies into making major decisions and altering or reversing plans. They drew commanders&#39; attention to less important details in operations at the expense of maintaining balance over the big picture. This work focuses on the frictions of two important functions - command and communication. Command frictions in the Army of the Potomac, for example, caused a great deal of confusion in recognizing who was in charge at any one time or place. Communication frictions altered Lee&#39;s original plan to move towards Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and diverted the Army of Northern Virginia to Gettysburg; they caused forward elements of the Confederate army to provoke a general engagement against Lee&#39;s instructions; they misdirected thousands of troops away from the battle and caused unnecessary casualties. &#34;Command and Communication Frictions in the Gettysburg Campaign&#34; illustrates the effect these two functions had in determining the outcome of the campaign. This work uses a variety of incidents, some familiar, to illustrate their serious impact on the battle - at least as much as troops in combat affected the result. The examples presented deal mainly with the high commands of the armies, especially the Army of the Potomac. The high command level was where the most important decisions were made to influence the progress of the army and the destiny its troops. Even though this study concentrates on frictions in the Gettysburg campaign, the revelations from this one operation, nevertheless, can be applied to any battle of any war. Philip M. Cole&#39;s book Command and Communication Frictions in the Gettysburg Campaign brings about an interesting scholarship to the battle and campaign which has been so written about over and over again. But with grace, he has brought a new look into that which has been studied so prominently with fresh air... Cole&#39;s study on the command and communication frictions is more than just another Gettysburg study; it is a look into the structure and reason for some of the major problems in the battle when it comes to command... One of the most interesting new points which Cole brings out is that Hooker did not just &#34;make time&#34; as Coddington states in his work; he had many communication frictions between himself and the high command in Washington. Another problem with communication he brings about is the use of time on the battlefield and just how much time it takes to send orders around on the field. Part of the command friction which was most interesting was the friction with senior commanders and wing commanders. Sometimes with complete disregard for orders, there were great issues among the men in the army. One thing which should have been obvious, but seems new in this work, is the personal relationships which are created through experience and can be a problem when the command changes. These studies are some of the reasons that this book should be among the library of any Gettysburg enthusiast... Cole&#39;s work is one of the best studies presented on command in quite some time and though it has been in print for about eight years, should be part of any study of Gettysburg by Civil War historians. This book is highly recommended for any interested in command structure or issues during the Gettysburg Campaign. 5 Star Review by Matthew Bartlett posted on goodreads.com December, 2013</p><p></p><h2>Metamorphoses of Science Fiction</h2><p>Metamorphoses of Science Fiction [paperback] Suvin, Darko [Feb 01, 1979]</p><p>Darko Suvin, scholar, critic and poet, was born in Yugoslavia, studied at the universities of Zagreb, Bristol, the Sorbonne and Yale and has taught in Europe and North America.

Not only did this paradigm shift transform our relationship to the latter, it also restored a political and social content to science fiction itself, making of the latter an implicit or explicit Brechtian estrangement-effect. <i>Metamorphoses of Science Fiction </i>is thereby an indispensable companion to the study of both genres, which durably integrates them into literary history and theory as such.�<br> (Fredric Jameson, Knut Schmidt Nielsen Professor of Comparative Literature, Duke University)</p><h2>Prime Time Crime (The Hardy Boys #109)</h2><p>Contestants on &#34;The Four O&#39;Clock Scholar,&#34; a game show for teens, Frank and Joe Hardy suspect foul play when the show&#39;s host disappears and their investigation uncovers danger, deceit, and dirty tricks</p><p></p><h2>Mediterranean In The Ancient World</h2><p>This general reader&#39;s history of the ancient mediterranean combines a thorough grasp of the scholarship of the day with an great historian&#39;s gift for imaginative reconstruction and inspired analogy.

The first in King&#39;s epic Dark Tower series.</p><p>Thirty-three years, a horrific and life-altering accident, and thousands of desperately rabid fans in the making, Stephen King's quest to complete his magnum opus rivals the quest of Roland and his band of gunslingers who inhabit the Dark Tower series. Loyal DT fans and new readers alike will appreciate this revised edition of <i>The Gunslinger</i>, which breathes new life into Roland of Gilead, and offers readers a "clearer start and slightly easier entry into Roland's world."<p> King writes both a new introduction and foreword to this revised edition, and the ever-patient, ever-loyal "constant reader" is rewarded with secrets to the series's inception. That a "magic" ream of green paper and a Robert Browning poem, came together to reveal to King his "ka" is no real surprise (this is King after all), but who would have thought that the squinty-eyed trio of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach would set the author on his true path to the Tower? While King credits Tolkien for inspiring the "quest and magic" that pervades the series, it was Sergio Leone's <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</i> that helped create the epic proportions and "almost absurdly majestic western backdrop" of Roland's world.</p><p> To King, <i>The Gunslinger</i> demanded revision because once the series was complete it became obvious that "the beginning was out of sync with the ending." While the revision adds only 35 pages, Dark Tower purists will notice the changes to Allie's fate and Roland's interaction with Cort, Jake, and the Man in Black--all stellar scenes that will reignite the hunger for the rest of the series. Newcomers will appreciate the details and insight into Roland's life. The revised Roland of Gilead (nee Deschain) is embodied with more humanity--he loves, he pities, he regrets. What DT fans might miss is the same ambiguity and mystery of the original that gave the original its pulpy underground feel (back when King himself awaited word from Roland's world). <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>Stephen King, the world&#39;s bestselling novelist, was educated at the University of Maine at Orono.

Think again. Leadership means influence. Young or old, man or woman, if you're a Christian, God has called you to influence others. In your church, your job, your school, your social circle, or the quietness of your home, someone is watching and waiting to follow your lead.<br><br> But what does leadership look like in a Christian? Most Christian leadership gurus today look more to corporate America for answers than to Scripture. The result is an unbiblical leadership model that sounds Christian but looks like the world-leadership based on power, personality, manipulation, and coercion.<br><br> Drawing on decades of leadership experience, tested and tempered by decades of in-depth study of God's Word, John MacArthur offers you an alternative model for true, spiritual leadership. In The Book on Leadership, John explores the life of the ultimate Christian leader, the apostle Paul, and uses Scripture to take on the common myths about what a leader really is and does. You'll also benefit from John's wise, practical counsel for budding leaders. A great tool for not only developing your leadership, but also knowing how to recognize godly leadership when you see it.</p><p></p><h2>My Likeness Taken: Daguerreian Portraits in America, 1840-1860</h2><p>During the nineteenth century&#x2015;a time of great technical and cultural change&#x2015;fashion was a cultivating force in the development of American society, influenced by one&#x2019;s social status, geographic location, and economic standing.

The Hollywood location scout and former stuntman is in the Big Apple hoping to capture the unvarnished memories of longtime Kitchen residents such as Ettie Washington in a no-budget documentary film. But when a suspicious fire ravages the elderly woman's crumbling tenement, Pellam realizes that someone might want the past to stay buried. <br> As more buildings and lives go up in flames, Pellam takes to the streets, seeking the twisted pyromaniac who sells services to the highest bidder. But Pellam is unaware that the fires are merely flickering preludes to the arsonist's ultimate masterpiece, a conflagration of nearly unimaginable proportion, with Hell's Kitchen -- and John Pellam -- at its blackened and searing epicenter.</p><p>Perennial bestselling author Jeffrey Deaver's alter ego, William Jefferies, knows a thing or two about Hollywood. So does John Pellam, the hero of his previous <i>Shallow Graves</i> and <i>Bloody River Blues</i> and the latest in the series, <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>. Pellam made a name for himself as a director before a stint in San Quentin took him off the fast track. Since his release he's been earning his keep as a location scout and not so incidentally shooting a documentary about New York's Hell's Kitchen, which he hopes will propel him back into the career that skidded south after he ran afoul of the law. <p> Pellam has found the star of his new film, one Ettie Washington, who has lived in the neighborhood for decades and is the perfect voice to tell the story of an area that's losing its old-time seediness to urban gentrification. But then Ettie's tenement goes up in a blaze that kills a small boy and puts her right in the public eye--as a suspect. It's only the beginning of a series of fires, each one more deadly. The cops know Ettie couldn't have set the others, since she's been in jail, but they're convinced she knows who did. Pellam has his own reasons for getting Ettie off the hook and embarking on a search for the real pyromaniac. Jeffries saves the best one for the very end of this taut, well-paced, and highly atmospheric thriller. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Jeffery Deaver&nbsp;is the #1 international bestselling author of more than forty novels, three collections of short stories, and a nonfiction law book.

Hemingway met and fell in love with nurse Kurowsky in the Red Cross hospital in Milan while recuperating from wounds inflicted at the Italian front during World War I. Their alleged affair was the basis for A Farewell to Arms-she appeared as Catherine Barkley. She eventually jilted him, and he later killed her in his novel. Included here are sections from her private diary from the time Hemingway was her patient as well as her letters to him. A remembrance by fellow patient Villard and an essay by Hemingway scholar Nagel add to the proceedings. This volume offers fascinating firsthand information on one of the most important events in Hemingway's life and has a place in all serious American literature collections.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.This collaborative volume, which sorts out the facts behind A Farewell to Arms , contains the "emotionally restricted" diary of von Kurowsky, the American nurse with whom Hemingway fell in love in a Milan hospital in 1918; her effusively affectionate and concerned 52 letters to him; 14 of his idealistic letters to his family, which disclose a good deal about his forceful, exuberant personality; and hospital reminiscences by Villard, one of his fellow-patients. In a detailed study, Nagel, English professor at Northeastern, discusses how Hemingway's romanticized Farewell differs from his actual experiences. The material assembled here, most of which has not been previously published, contradicts the assertions of Hemingway's major biographers about his military service and war wounds.

Before he can get out of it though, there&#39;s murder in the mix - or is it suicide?</p><p>CATRIONA MCPHERSON was born near Edinburgh, where she received her Ph.D. She now lives in Davis, California, with her husband and two cats.<b>Dandy Gilver and an Unsuitable Day for a Murder</b><br><b>1</b>Whatever I was expecting when I decided to take a turn around Dunfermline - I was early for my appointment and it was a particularly pleasant day - it was not this air of jubilance. Indeed, if one were taxed with naming five jubilant towns and ran out of inspiration after Paris, Barcelona, New Orleans and Rio one would not search for the fifth in Scotland's Gazetteer. (And if one were taxed with naming five jubilant towns in Scotland and did not, for some reason, face the facts and pay the forfeit right away, I daresay Dunfermline would still not spring to mind.)Yet I could not help but notice that, today at least, the whole town effervesced in the most remarkable way. The whole city, I should properly say, for - as Hugh never tires of reminding me with much retelling of the glories of King Robert and the shenanigans of Malcolm Canmore - Dunfermline <i>is</i> a city and one groaning with history too: the birthplace of Charles I and more lately (not to mention more beneficially to the world at large) Andrew Carnegie. Indeed I was passing the Carnegie Library now, thinking how generous it was of him to endow it, since here was one place he might have been sure to get a library named after him anyway.As for the present mood, the weather had to be responsible for some of it, but soft spring sunshine and the kind of gentle breeze that teases at hat ribbons and turns the new leaves over to show their silvery undersides only go so far and further explanation was needed for the exuberance of the window displays in all the small shops along Abbot Street and up the Kirkgate, the newly planted flower beds glimpsed through the park gates, as neat as samplers with their white pansies and pink tulips stitchedinto the smooth brown backing, and the giddy high spirits of the girls who flitted about in giggling pairs and threesomes, all decked out in their new spring costumes and with their shingles glistening.There was plenty for them to see: behind the plate-glass windows of a department store called - rather splendidly - House of Hepburn (Hosiers, Glovers, Clothiers and Milliners), instead of the expected outcrops of sensible hats and pyramids of sturdy china there was a series of tableaux showing a beautiful mannequin girl accompanied by a broad-shouldered mannequin admirer, the pair set before a succession of lurid backdrops and dressed in the height of fashion for golf, tennis, the seaside, and - against the most improbable backcloth of all - yachting, complete with ice buckets and open picnic hampers. In the seaside window, I was almost sure, they stood on real sand.I walked on. At another department store further up on the High Street - Aitkens' Emporium (Tailors, Mantle Makers, Silk Merchants, Domestic Bazaar): no less splendid, with just as many enormous windows <i>and</i> a revolving door - one could hardly see the sensible hats and sturdy china for exotic arrangements of ostrich and peacock feathers in urns, silver-sprayed fans of seaweed and gold-sprayed shoals of little fishes sprouting out of conch shells (also gold), with billows of sequined silk on the floor for waves, and around the top of each window ... bunting. Actual bunting, in the dark mauve and gold livery of the store and hanging from golden rope with tasselled ends like the cords which used to hold back dining-room curtains.There was, however, no time to penetrate the revolving door in search of whatever unheard-of delights the fish and feathers were there to advertise: I had used up my store of time in hand and was in danger of being late unless I hurried along and struck the right street first time.The right street - Abbey Park Place - was very easily found, since my amble around the town had taken me close to one end of it already although I was surprised to see how far I had since wandered, but number fifteen was not at all what I had beenimagining. The postcard I had received was of good quality, thick and cream-coloured with the address deeply engraved in plain black, but I had not foreseen how one of at least fifteen houses in a street in Dunfermline could be anything except a sandstone villa, with a bay window above and one below, joined to its neighbour at the front door and inside stairway. In fact, 'No. 15' was merely the Post Office's designation of Abbey Park itself that presented stone gateposts and a lodge house to the street which I supposed had sprung up around it and taken its name. I glanced at my wristwatch and opened the small pedestrian gate set into one of the large ones.There were limits, I soon saw, lodge or no lodge; the drive was only yards long - hardly a drive at all - and the house lay at hand just before me. Nevertheless, it was a solid chunk of good grey Georgian stone, sitting there as calm as a bull walrus on a sunny rock; one of those houses where the carriage circle reaches up to meet the front door but whose grounds drop away to lawns at the back so that the porch spans the basement area like a covered bridge (they always make me think, for some reason, of a sedan chair) and its size and solidity despite the deficiencies of the drive presented me with a problem.For there was no name engraved on the card in my hand, just the address, and I had expected, after rapping on the door of the sandstone villa, to be greeted by whoever had sent it. Clearly, however, this smart black door would be answered by a servant - perhaps even a butler - and I did not know for whom to ask. I pulled the bell and squinted at the card again: <i>Please come at eleven o'clock on the morning of the twenty-fifth. I have an urgent commission to put to you</i>, and an unintelligible string of initials written in a wavery but deliberate woman's hand.Butler indeed it was who answered, a portly sort in mauve and gold, and drawing myself up I conjured my grandest stare and my coolest voice to address him (taking a moment to note, with sadness, from how near at hand I conjured them these days).'Mrs Gilver,' I said, 'to see the lady of the house.' And I waved the card in his direction. He recognised it, but continued frowning.'To see ... Mrs Jack?' he asked. I gave a nod that might have cracked a walnut under my chin; a gesture I had seen in a police superintendent of my acquaintance and had at once decided to add to my own repertoire. 'Step this way, madam,' said the butler and swept me inside.As we clacked across the tiles of the porch, under a soaring arch, across an expanse of pillared hall and under a second soaring arch I peered at the signature, trying and failing to resolve that final initial into a J, then my attention was caught by the sudden blaze of light as we entered a library. The butler left me and I wandered over to the windows, the card - for the moment - forgotten.The room faced due south and was bowed out at the far side, with the three tall windows of the bow looking over the lawns I had glimpsed while arriving. And the light simply poured in - warm, thick, honey-coloured light - rolling lazily in through the rippled old glass and washing the room in gold, making it pulse and gleam.Perhaps it was not a library at all, I judged at a second glance around. To be sure, it was panelled from floor to ceiling and the ceiling itself was covered with panels too, but the wood was some species unknown to me - a rich glossy amber, smelling of wax and resin in the sunshine, and as far from the good dark oak of libraries as could be imagined. Add to this the fact that there were no bookshelves and it seemed less of a library still.Then, lifting up the velvet cover from one of a number of shrouded tables, I saw that there <i>were</i> books after all. The cover had been guarding a glass-topped case, flattish but tilted a little for display, and in it was what looked to be a book of hours, open at a calendar page. I bent over this surprising item the better to study its decoration and marvel at its obvious antiquity and was still in that undignified position - stooped and snooping - when a gentle cough from the doorway caused me to drop the cover back again. The brass rod along its edge clattered onto the frame and, turning, I banged my ankle against one of the table legs.'Mrs Gilver?' said a voice.'Mrs Jack?' She had stopped in the doorway and stood there for a moment in a frame of that glowing, honeyed wood like a painted saint in an altar panel. It would have been a comely setting for ninety-nine women out of a hundred but it did not flatter this one, at least not today. She was about fifty, I guessed, but anxiety or exhaustion had further aged her; her face was tight, her skin pale and her long dark-red hair was bundled back into an inexpert knot from which great hanks of it were escaping. She wore a wool shawl over her dress and tugged it closer around herself as she moved towards me.'Have you brought news?' she said, searching my face. Her eyes were drawn up into diamond shapes, red-rimmed.'I--' I began, but she interrupted me.'Have you discovered her? Has she been found?''I--' I said again and then mutely held out the postcard for her to see. She blinked at it and then looked back at me.'From my mother,' she said. 'My goodness, my mother actually wrote to ... Who are you?''I do apologise, Mrs Jack,' I answered. 'My name is Dandy Gilver. I asked for the lady of the house, you see. Perhaps someone might fetch your mother now?''But who are you?' she said again, all politeness, all decorum driven away by whatever suffering had caused the careless hairdressing and the shawl.I hesitated. It would be monstrously unprofessional to discuss a case with anyone but my client in person and ordinarily I would not have dreamt of doing so, but surely her worry sprang from the same source as her mother's card.'I'm a detective,' I said. 'Now, someone's missing?''A detective,' she echoed, going over to a ...</p><h2>Edward Bawden</h2><p><p>This comprehensive survey of the career of Edward Bawden (1903-89) accompanied a major exhibition at Dulwich Picture Gallery and brings together his most significant work in watercolour, printmaking, design and illustration.<br>Bawden began his career in the 1920s as a precociously talented designer and illustrator, and he successfully reinvented himself time and again as the decades passed while always retaining a distinctive freshness, humour and humanity in his work.

S. Trow&#39;s brilliant exposition on the state of American culture and twentieth-century life. Published to widespread acclaim, Within the Context of No Context became an immediate classic and is, to this day, a favorite work of writers and critics alike. Both a chilling commentary on the times in which it was written and an eerie premonition of the future, Trow&#39;s work locates and traces, describes and analyzes the components of change in contemporary America -- a culture increasingly determined by the shallow worlds of consumer products, daytime television, and celebrity heroes. &#34;This elegant little book is essential reading for anyone interested in the demise, the terminal silliness, of our culture.&#34; -- John Irving, The New York Times Book Review; &#34;In this elegant, poignant essay, written with the grace of a master stylist, George Trow articulates the accelerated impermanence of American culture with a precision that is both flaunting and devastating.&#34; -- Rudy Wurlitrer; &#34;Within the Context of No Context is a masterpiece of the century that belongs on a shelf next to Theodore Adorno&#39;s Minima Moralia and Guy Debord&#39;s The Society of the Spectacle.&#34; -- Michael Tolkin; &#34;Within the Context of No Context may appear to be a book of the mind, for it is suffused with such a keen intelligence, but it is actually a book of the heart -- passionate, brave, and stirring.&#34; -- Sue Halpern.</p><p>Long-time <i>New Yorker</i> writer George W. S. Trow first published the long title essay of this book in 1981, and it now appears with a companion piece, "Collapsing Dominant." Taken together, the two essays are a trenchant and often scathing examination of American culture. As Trow surveys the landscape, he observes that television has created a land of "no context," which it then gleefully chronicles. The many examples he cites of things he has witnessed in the mass media are alarming not for what he has seen--for we have all seen this stuff--but for the intense, and at times lacerating, insight with which he views the passing parade of frivolity. <i>Within the Context of No Context</i> is a slim book that does much to explain modern American society, and the thoughts in its pages will resonate for a long time.First appearing in The New Yorker in 1978 (Trow wrote the "Talk of the Town" pieces) and published by Little, Brown in 1981, this volume dissects 20th-century American culture and how it had spiraled downward in ever-tightening circles into decay.

Over the past forty years he has gained a devoted following in the United States and Europe for his increasingly bitter--some say hysterical--censure of U.S. &#34;crimes.&#34; Chomsky has complained about being ignored by mainstream publications such as the &#34;New York Times,&#34; but in fact his steady stream of polemical works, like the best-selling &#34;9-11,&#34; have made him the center of a veritable cult. In &#34;The Anti-Chomsky Reader,&#34; editors Peter Collier and David Horowitz have assembled a set of essays that analyze Chomsky&#39;s intellectual career and the evolution of his anti-Americanism. The essays in this provocative book focus on subjects such as Chomsky&#39;s bizarre involvement with Holocaust revisionism, his apologies for Khmer Rouge tyrant Pol Pot, and his claim that America&#39;s policies in Latin America in the 1980s were comparable to Nazism. Scholar Paul Bogdanor writes about Chomsky&#39;s hatred of Israel. Ronald Radosh and David Horowitz discuss his gloating reaction to the September 11 attack. Linguists Paul Postal and Robert Levine reevaluate Chomsky&#39;s linguistics and find the same qualities there that others see in his politics: &#34;a deep contempt for the truth, descents into incoherence, and verbal abuse of those who disagree with him.&#34; &#34;The Anti-Chomsky Reader&#34; presents a fascinating composite portrait of a man who arguably is our most influential public intellectual.</p><p>Peter Collier and David Horowitz have written well-regarded biographies of the Rockefellers, the Kennedys and the Fords. They also co-authored &#34;Destructive Generation: Second Thoughts about the Sixties.&#34; David Horowitz&#39;s essays appear regularly in frontpagemagazine.com"Collier, Horowitz, and their six other authors have produced a book that has long been needed.

Jerome Garitee remedies this situation in this carefully researched and fully documented study of all aspects of Baltimore&#39;s extensive privateering operations on both land and sea. After tracing the roots and growth of privateering until its history overlaps that of Baltimore, Professor Garitee describes that port&#39;s rapid development as an international entrepot in the four decades before the War of 1812. The merchants and mariners who built the port, aided by the shipbuilders whose skill made the famous Baltimore schooners the fastest sailing vessels of their time, became the owners and operators of the private armed ships that successfully defended the city during the wart. Professor Garitee demonstrates that, like the mariners themselves, the in-port participants displayed both courage and competence. In addition to analyzing the shipowners&#39; backgrounds and wartime roles, the author describes in detail all the business and legal aspects of the privateering system - from the financing, insuring, equipping, and staffing of the privateers to the complexities of prize distribution through admiralty courts and auctions. This comprehensive study thus enlarges our understanding not only of privateering, but also of the War of 1812 and of the social, political, and economic history of the period.</p><p></p><h2>102 Minutes: The Untold Story of the Fight to Survive Inside the Twin Towers</h2><p>The dramatic and moving account of the struggle for life inside the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11, when every minute counted<br><br>At 8:46 am on September 11, 2001, 14,000 people were inside the twin towers-reading e-mails, making trades, eating croissants at Windows on the World. Over the next 102 minutes, each would become part of a drama for the ages, one witnessed only by the people who lived it-until now. <br><br>Of the millions of words written about this wrenching day, most were told from the outside looking in. <i>New York Times</i> reporters Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn have taken the opposite-and far more revealing-approach. Reported from the perspectives of those inside the towers, <i>102 Minutes</i> captures the little-known stories of ordinary people who took extraordinary steps to save themselves and others. Beyond this stirring panorama stands investigative reporting of the first rank. An astounding number of people actually survived the plane impacts but were unable to escape, and the authors raise hard questions about building safety and tragic flaws in New York's emergency preparedness.<br><br>Dwyer and Flynn rely on hundreds of interviews with rescuers, thousands of pages of oral histories, and countless phone, e-mail, and emergency radio transcripts. They cross a bridge of voices to go inside the infernos, seeing cataclysm and heroism, one person at a time, to tell the affecting, authoritative saga of the men and women-the nearly 12,000 who escaped and the 2,749 who perished-as they made 102 minutes count as never before.&nbsp;<i>102 Minutes</i> is a 2005 National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction.</p><p>In <i>102 Minutes: The Untold Story of the Fight to Survive Inside the Twin Towers</i>, <i>New York Times</i> writers Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn vividly recreate the 102-minute span between the moment Flight 11 hit the first Twin Tower on the morning of September 11, 2001, and the moment the second tower collapsed, all from the perspective of those inside the buildings--the 12,000 who escaped, and the 2,749 who did not. It's becoming easier, years later, to forget the profound, visceral responses the Trade Center attacks evoked in the days and weeks following September 11. Using hundreds of interviews, countless transcripts of radio and phone communications, and exhaustive research, Dwyer and Flynn bring that flood of responses back--from heartbreak to bewilderment to fury. The randomness of death and survival is heartbreaking. One man, in the second tower, survived because he bolted from his desk the moment he heard the first plane hit; another, who stayed at his desk on the 97th floor, called his wife in his final moments to tell her to cancel a surprise trip he had planned. In many cases, the deaths of those who survived the initial attacks but were killed by the collapse of the towers were tragically avoidable. Building code exemptions, communication breakdowns between firefighters and police, and policies put in place by building management to keep everyone inside the towers in emergencies led, the authors argue, to the deaths of hundreds who might otherwise have survived. September 11 is by now both familiar and nearly mythological. Dwyer and Flynn's accomplishment is recounting that day's events in a style that is stirring, thorough, and refreshingly understated. <i>--Erica C.

It should be required reading for scholars, clergy, and serious lay people alike. --Gerd L�demann, University of G�ttingen, Germany<br><br>... this book is a clear, easy-to-understand summary of much of Acts scholarship from the past decade. It is a valuable resource especially for students of the New Testament outside of the scholarly guild, such as upper-division majors in religious studies and history of Christianity, seminary students, and clergy. --Review of Biblical Literature</p><h2>All the Money in the World: What the Happiest People Know About Getting and Spending</h2><p>How happy would you be if you had all the money in the world? The universal lament about money is that there is never enough. We spend endless hours obsessing over our budgets and investments, trying to figure out ways to stretch every dollar. We try to follow the advice of money gurus and financial planners, then kick ourselves whenever we spend too much or save too little. For all of the stress and effort we put into every choice, why are most of us unhappy about our finances?<br><br>According to Laura Vanderkam, the key is to change your perspective. Instead of looking at money as a scarce resource, consider it a tool that you can use creatively to build a better life for yourself and the people you care about. <br><p>For instance, the average couple spends $5,000 on engagement and wedding rings, making these pricey purchases largely because everyone else does. But what if you decided to spend $300 on rings and apply the rest to future date nights, weekend getaways, and thinking-of-you bouquets over the next ten years? In he long run, what would bring more joy to your marriage? Likewise, will owning a home with a pristine lawn and a two-car garage&#x2014;the American Dream&#x2014;really make you more satisfied? Or are you saving up for this investment just because financial planners tell you it&#x2019;s worth it?<br></p><p>Vanderkam shows how each of us can figure out better ways to use what we have to build the lives we want. Drawing on the latest happiness research as well as the stories of dozens of real people, Vanderkam offers a contrarian approach that forces us to examine our own beliefs, goals, and values.<br></p><p>Among her advice:<br></p><ul> <li>Laugh at the Joneses: It&#x2019;s human nature to compare yourself to those around you, but you can create lifestyle hat rings you personal satisfaction without copying your neighbors.<br> </li></ul><ul> <li>Give yourself the best weekend ever: Studies show that experiences often bring more pleasure than material goods. With a little planning and creativity, you can give yourself a memorable getaway without leaving town or going broke.<br> </li></ul><ul> <li>Embrace the selfish joy of giving: Giving back not only helps you build karma, it also helps you build a community&#x2014;which is much more fulfilling than a tax deduction. All the Money in the World is a practical and inspiring guide that shows how money can buy happiness&#x2014;if we spend it wisely.</li></ul></p><p><b>Laura Vanderkam</b> is the author of 168 <i>Hours: You Have More Time Than You Think</i> and <i>Grindhopping:&nbsp; Build a Rewarding Career Without Paying Your Dues</i>, which the New York Times hailed as &#x201c;loaded with smart observations.&#x201d; Her work has appeared in the Wall Street Journal, City Journal, the Huffington Post, USA Today, Scientific American, and Reader&#x2019;s Digest, among other publications.

Now, the story continues... Thomas Travis had always thought the toughest streets in the ghettos of Atlanta were next door to hell. But he didn&#x2019;t know just how close they were until the threat of racial violence sent him fleeing down the stairs of an abandoned building...only to fall headlong into a tortured realm of fire and ice, the place of the damned. The only chance of escape was to trust the strange elderly woman who met him there and insisted on being his guide. She claimed to know the way out, but it would lead through all the terrifying circles of divine judgment, each one deeper and more tormenting than the last. In the lowest pit, the Lord of Darkness himself lay in wait. Thomas had lived a godless life, and now there was hell to pay. If his soul could be purged on the journey, he just might make it. But the odds were against him. In hell, the only guarantee is justice...and the only way out is down.&nbsp;<b>About the Author</b>PAUL THIGPEN, PhD, is an award-winning journalist and the best-selling author of more than twenty-five books, including <i>A Dictionary of Quotes from the Saints, Blood of the Martyrs, </i>and <i>Seed of the Church</i>.

A lifetime of learning later, Welsch&#x2019;s enthusiasm is undimmed, if somewhat more enlightened. In <i>Embracing Fry Bread</i> Welsch tells the story of his lifelong relationship with Native American culture, which, beginning in earnest with the study of linguistic practices of the Omaha tribe during a college anthropology course, resulted in his becoming an adopted member and kin of both the Omaha and the Pawnee tribes.&nbsp;With requisite humility and a healthy dose of humor, Welsch describes his long pilgrimage through Native life, from lessons in the vagaries of &#x201c;Indian time&#x201d; and the difficulties of reservation life, to the joy of being allowed to participate in special ceremonies and developing a deep and lasting love of fry bread. Navigating another culture is a complicated task, and Welsch shares his mistakes and successes with engaging candor. Through his serendipitous wanderings, he finds that the more he learns about Native culture the more he learns about himself&#x2014;and about a way of life whose allure offers true insight into indigenous America.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Roger Welsch is an adjunct professor of anthropology at the University of Nebraska&#x2013;Lincoln and the author of more than forty books, including <i>Touching the Fire: Buffalo</i> <i>Dancers, the Sky Bundle, and Other Tales</i> and <i>My Nebraska</i>, both available in Bison Books editions.<br>&#x201c;If it can be said of anyone who is not an Indian (Native American, American Indian) that he or she has the &#x2018;soul of an Indian,&#x2019; it has to be said of Roger Welsch. He offers the one thing that diverse groups of people, indeed the world, need to get along: understanding.&#x201d;&#x2014;Joseph Marshall III, author of <i>The Lakota Way: Stories and Lessons for Learning</i><i></i>&nbsp;<p></p> (Joseph Marshall III 2012-03-16)<br><br>"Welsch's natural warmth and skill as a storyteller, and his obvious respect for the individuals he encounters, come through clearly in his writing, and it's easy to see why so many people, from so many backgrounds, might be honored to call him "friend.""&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly </i> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2012-10-08)<br><br>"Though an anthropology scholar, Welsch is never pedantic or preachy. Instead, this is a heartfelt and very personal story, rich in wry and self-deprecating humor."&#x2014;Deborah Donovan, <i>Booklist</i> (Deborah Donovan <i>Booklist</i> 2012-11-15)<br><br>"Welsch's gratitude toward the Omahas and Pawnees is real, his outrage at their painful history is justified, and his story is proof that Native American culture is still alive and complex."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i> (<i>Kirkus</i> 2012-12-01)<br><br>"Welsch manifests himself as a listener who has spent fifty-five years involved in Native culture where he has made uncountable friends. His ability to write honest prose, both informative and erudite, captivates from the beginning."&#x2014;Wynne Summers, <i>Great Plains Quarterly</i> (Wynne Summers <i>Great Plains Quarterly</i>)</p><h2>Read For Your Life</h2><p>Most teens already know what wealth and just-plain-fun books contain.

The Goldbecks have been fixtures in the American whole-foods movement for more than a decade, and here they have thoroughly succeeded with their goal of creating "mouth-watering food that tastes great and happens to be healthful." <p> They call the whole-foods diet a "Darwinian" one because it's similar to the diet that our ancestors followed 50,000 years ago--"foods provided by our habitat." The Goldbecks write, "Just as we cannot put unleaded gasoline in our 1950 Chevy pickup and expect it to run efficiently, modern technological foods may be inappropriate for our prehistoric bodies." The simplicity of this theory is outstanding, although rushed lifestyles and the ubiquity of convenience foods make it easy to eat overprocessed, unnutritious junk at every meal.

If a dish doesn't make our taste buds dance, quite frankly we're not interested in it, no matter how nutritious it is.

In addition to the new &#x201c;musts,&#x201d; Thomson has added key figures from film history&#x2014;lively anatomies of Graham Greene, Eddie Cantor, Pauline Kael, Abbott and Costello, No�l Coward, Hoagy Carmichael, Dorothy Gish, Rin Tin Tin, and more. <br><br>Here is a great, rare book, one that encompasses the chaos of art, entertainment, money, vulgarity, and nonsense that we call the movies. Personal, opinionated, funny, daring, provocative, and passionate, it is the one book that every filmmaker and film buff must own. Time Out named it one of the ten best books of the 1990s. Gavin Lambert recognized it as &#x201c;a work of imagination in its own right.&#x201d; Now better than ever&#x2014;a masterwork by the man playwright David Hare called &#x201c;the most stimulating and thoughtful film critic now writing.&#x201d;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Atlas of the Holocaust</h2><p>Maps trace each phase of the Holocaust from random killings and expulsion from towns and villages, to the setting up of ghettos and death camps</p><p>Sir Martin Gilbert, the author of many historical works, was appointed official biographer of Sir Winston Churchill in 1968. He wrote six of the eight volumes of the landmark biographical series and also compiled ten volumes of Churchill documents. In addition, he is the author of a definitive history of the Holocaust, a series of twelve historical atlases, and comprehensive studies of both World War I and World War II. He is married with three children and lives in London. Since 1962, he has been a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford (an Honorary Fellow since 1994). He was knighted in 1995.First published by Macmillan (1982) and later by Pergamon (1988), <i>Atlas of the Holocaust</i> features 316 black-and-white maps showing "in chronological sequence, the destruction of each of the main Jewish communities of Europe, as well as acts of resistance and revolt, avenues of escape and rescue, and the fate of individuals." Written by a preeminent historian (Gilbert has written several books on the Holocaust and is the official biographer of Churchill), the atlas presents a chilling portrait--using primarily maps rather than pictures--of one nation's attempt to wipe out an entire people.<p>After the list of maps and a key to special symbols used on them, Gilbert's brief introduction features a map that shows a personal portrait of the fate of 17 people out of the 6,000,000 killed. The atlas proper opens with a map depicting anti-Jewish violence before World War I and continues chronologically from there. Maps typically include numbers of Jews living in an individual country, town, or village before the Holocaust; the number seeking refuge in a place; or the number executed in a place. Maps vary greatly in general themes and are not all devoted to the more infamous mass executions. "The Hirschsprung Family Deported, 15 September 1942," for example, traces the movement of one family. The atlas graphically depicts how wide-ranging the Holocaust was. All maps are accompanied by very readable text, and approximately 50 photographs are spread throughout the book.</p><p>A comparison with the 1982 Macmillan work reveals that there has not been any revision to the maps or to the text accompanying them. All maps in this volume, in fact, bear a 1982 copyright. The bibliography--a superb nine-page list of unpublished and published sources--has likewise not been updated, failing, for example, to cite the <i>Encyclopedia of the Holocaust</i>. The only addition to the previous printings of this work are two indexes: a 23-page index of places, which gives map numbers for each listed on a map, and a four-page index of individuals mentioned in the text. They are great improvements over the 1982 index, which listed only the principal camps and mass-murder sites.</p><p>Libraries owning a previous edition of this work may not find it necessary to purchase this newer printing, save for the convenience of having a good index. However, given the extremely reasonable price of this volume, the atlas constitutes an exceptional value and deserves a place in every high school, public, and academic library. The text accompanying the maps may even warrant the purchase of an additional copy for the circulating collection. <i></i></p></p><h2>Presence and Process: A Path Toward Transformative Faith and Inclusive Community</h2><p><p>The North American Christian church of the early twenty-first century finds itself in a period of decline. A growing percentage of young adults are not entering the front doors of churches while at the same time older and previously dedicated Christians are leaving. Coinciding with the deflation of the Western church is the explosion in popular culture of the mindfulness movement, which emphasizes meditation practices derived from Buddhism. These concurrent phenomena&#x2014;the decline of Christendom in North America and the rise of a Westernized form of Buddhism and various secularized applications of Buddhist meditative practice&#x2014;form an interesting juxtaposition that warrants exploration.</p></p><p>Daniel P. Coleman holds an M.A. in Religion from the Earlham School of Religion and describes himself as a progressive Christian Quaker theologian with Buddhist leanings. His work touches on contemplative spirituality, process theology, interfaith dialogue, Quakerism, and biblical studies. Daniel and his wife, Carla, live in Seattle, Washington.<p>&#x201c;In&nbsp;<em>Presence and Process</em>, Daniel Coleman has created a unique and useful synthesis&#x2014;showing how a convergence of perennialism, process theology, and mysticism (Christian, Buddhist, and Quaker) could have a profound role in fostering spiritual formation in this postmodern, post-Christendom age. This is a pioneering work of practical theology.&#x201d; - Richard Rohr, author of&nbsp;<em>Falling Upward: A Spirituality for the Two Halves of Life</em></p><p>&#x201c;<em>Presence and Process</em>&nbsp;is an amazing book. It provides the best, most compact introduction I&#x2019;ve come across to key concepts like mysticism, contemplation, and process theology. It explores the productive ferment that is taking place at the intersection of Christianity and Buddhism. And it invites practitioners to imagine a new kind of church for the journey before us. I highly recommend&nbsp;<em>Presence and Process</em>.&#x201d; - Brian D. McLaren, author of&nbsp;<em>The Great Spiritual Migration</em></p><p>&#x201c;After three decades in Quaker ministry, I&#x2019;ve noticed how religious traditions I once believed to be separate pursuits now merge as one. Truth, as it turns out, is happy to share the road with others.&nbsp; Daniel Coleman&#x2019;s helpful book,&nbsp;<em>Presence and Process</em>, marries Christianity and Buddhism for contemporary seekers. Both traditions are honored, both enriched, and both made better by Coleman&#x2019;s thoughtful union.&#x201d; - Philip Gulley, author of&nbsp;<em>Living the Quaker Way: Discover the Hidden Happiness in the Simple Life</em></p><p>&#x201c;Daniel Coleman&#x2019;s book points the way to a global spirituality, joining East and West, and theology and philosophy. Intellectually solid and spiritually insightful, Coleman&#x2019;s text captures the heart of the Buddhist and Christian mystical traditions in ways that respond to the needs of spiritual seekers of our time.&nbsp;<em>Presence and Process</em>&nbsp;is an excellent invitation to the growing global mysticism of our time in which spiritual pilgrims creatively integrate practices from diverse religious traditions and in so doing not only experience spiritual insight but transform these traditions themselves. In a time when religious institutions are struggling to survive, Coleman provides a pathway to institutional and spiritual transformation through lively global and earth-affirming spirituality.&#x201d; - Bruce Epperly, author of&nbsp;<em>Becoming Fire: Spiritual Practices for Global Christians and The Gospel According to Winnie the Pooh</em></p><p>&#x201c;Coleman works from a fertile field of thinkers in order to unpack&#x2014;as much as such a thing is possible&#x2014;the experiential core of Christian and Buddhist practices. His account of contemplation is a much-needed corrective to the empty moralism afflicting many religious communities. The resulting synthesis of Vipassana and apophasis has as much to offer the lay practitioner as the professional theologian.&#x201d; - J. R. Hustwit, author of&nbsp;<em>Interreligious Hermeneutics and the Pursuit of Truth</em></p><p>&#x201c;If Karl Rahner predicted that the survival of Christianity will depend on Christians becoming mystics, Daniel Coleman shows why that is the case and how Rahner&#x2019;s hopes might be realized. His review and comparison of Christian and Buddhist contemplative practices will speak to both those who are struggling with, as well as those who are looking beyond, organized religion. The book&#x2019;s brevity belies its engaging richness.&#x201d; - Paul F. Knitter, author of&nbsp;<em>Without Buddha I Could Not Be a Christian</em></p></p><h2>The Further Adventures of Nils</h2><p>Considered a masterpiece since first published in 1907, this enchanting, remarkably original work by a Nobel Prize-winning author records the adventures of a mischievous 14-year-old who is changed into a tiny being, transported across the Swedish countryside on the back of a goose, and learns about nature, geography, and folklore.</p><p></p><h2>Orange: Seeing Orange All Around Us (A+ Books)</h2><p>Introduces some common objects that are orange in color including carrots, pumpkins, and basketballs.</p><p>Sarah Schuette has written nearly 80 nonfiction children&#39;s books with themes relating to character values, cooking, family relationships, and the popular Spot It seek and find titles.

She and her husband live in Mexico and often collaborate on their books.Grade 1-3-- Adler makes Jefferson accessible to young children in this new addition to his biography series. In the brief text, he covers the main achievements and events in Jefferson's life and portrays him as an intellectual, inventor, lawyer, architect, and statesman who disliked presidential pomp. He mentions that, although opposed to the idea of slavery, Jefferson owned slaves throughout his life and several are depicted in the illustrations. Adler's writing is clear and objective, free of fictionalization, and easily read. It will also serve as a read-aloud. The format is attractive; each double-page spread contains a framed painting with short paragraphs superimposed on the illustration. The Wallners' charming watercolors include many details that show the furnishings, clothing, and daily life of 18th-century Virginia. Easier to read than Smith's Thomas Jefferson (Messner, 1989), the book is an informative introduction to this prominent American leader. --Jean H.

The author contends that the popular view that World War I was, in the words of historian John Keegan, &#34;tragic and unnecessary&#34;, is wrong. It is his argued belief that such a conclusion does not represent the cutting edge of research into the most controversial conflict in British history. Based on 20 years of research, as well as reflecting the interpretations of the revisioniest school of historians based around the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, the Imperial War Museum and the British Commission for Military History, this book challenges the fundamental assumptions underpinning the traditional belief that World War I was a wholly futile conflict.</p><p>Dr Gary Sheffield is Land Warfare Historian on the Higher Command and Staff Course, Joint Services Command and Staff College, Shrivenham, and Senior Lecturer at King&#39;s College London (War Studies Group).

A family patriarch relates all his life&#39;s adventures to his grandchildren; 2) The Refugees (1893). In Conan Doyle&#39;s own words, &#34;I take a New Englander, a Puritan, as one type of the seventeenth century, and a New Yorker, the woodman, as another, and I precipitate these two into the court of Louis XIV, and mix them up in the European history of that time - very much as Scott threw Quentin Durward, the young Scotchman, into the French court. I have taken a lot of pains to make these two types exact studies. Then I shift the scene back to America. It will be something new in the way of an American historical novel. You see it will be the story of the two continents. The woodman will use the phrases of the wood, and the New Englander is rather Biblical.&#34; and 3) Rodney Stone (1896) is an historical novel about boxing during the Regency period, that curiously brings together Lord Nelson and the sport of boxing. Doyle had always been fond of boxing, had reveled in the history of the prize-ring, and in Rodney Stone his enthusiasm and knowledge are apparent.. As usual the action-episodes are first-rate; and as usual the historical personages are not an integral part of the story, but Doyle wanted to reconstruct an age, and so Nelson, the Prince Regent, Sheridan, Fox, Beau Brummell, and others, pop in and out of the pages for the sole purpose of creating a &#34;period piece.&#34; Arthur Conan Doyle believed that this book was an important factor in the surge of interest in boxing after the turn of the century.</p><p></p><h2>M113 APC 1960&#x2013;75: US, ARVN, and Australian variants in Vietnam (New Vanguard)</h2><p><p>The M113 is the most widely used and versatile armored vehicle in the world.

It isn&#x2019;t the norm. There are plenty of people named Annunzio Napolitano or Bernie Feinberg or Leroy Washington Jr. Or even names like mine, Milan Jacovich. That&#x2019;s Yugoslavian&#x2015;Slovenian, to be more precise&#x2015;and in my old neighborhood on the East Side, or in Bernie&#x2019;s or Leroy&#x2019;s or Nunzio&#x2019;s neighborhoods, a guy with a hyphen in his name had better be either pretty good with his fists or damn fast on his feet.</p> <p>On this particular afternoon, one of those oppressive August days in Cleveland when the air clings like wet cotton and beer sales hit an annual high, I had just finished a big job for an electronics firm in the eastern suburbs and written them a thirty-six-page report on implementing security procedures, preventing industrial espionage, and keeping the ribbon clerks from stealing paper clips. It&#x2019;s not the most exciting type of job I get, but it was a nice change from spying on errant husbands and wives, or having guys with bent noses try to make mine look like theirs. The president of the electronics company had given me a little bonus and a glowing letter of reference, my bank account was healthier than it had been in a while, and I was feeling pretty satisfied with myself and with life in general. From past experience, I should have known that someone was going to rain all over the picnic&#x2015;someone always does. But even if I had thought about it, I wouldn&#x2019;t have figured it to happen that day. It was just too hot and muggy to start stirring up any shit. That&#x2019;s when my telephone rang and I first heard of Richardson Hippsley-Tate.</p> <p>You&#x2019;d expect a fellow with a hyphen to have a stuffy British accent, but this guy sounded more like New York than New Hyde Park. He was the general manager of the Lake Shore Hotel, a huge new resort-and-convention-center complex that had been completed just the past spring, with all the attendant hoopla, grand opening visits by show business and sports celebrities, and a ribbon cutting by Governor Kinnick capping a boring and windy speech. The Lake Shore had been built, after an internal battle in the city council chambers that had left several members either politically dead or mortally wounded, atop a landfill on the West Side overlooking Lake Erie. It catered to fast-track business executives, Fortune 500 corporations, the local fat cats, and the out-of-town idle rich who were perverse enough to want to spend their precious vacation time in Cleveland.</p> <p>When Hippsley-Tate called, he told me he needed to see me on &#x201c;a matter of great urgency.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what he said, a matter of great urgency.</p> <p>&#x201c;Could you be a little more specific, Mr. Hippsley-Tate?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not something I can talk about on the phone,&#x201d; he answered, &#x201c;but this hotel has been ripped off for a great deal of money, and I need you to help me get it back.&#x201d;</p> <p>I run a private security agency from my apartment in Cleveland Heights, so I assumed he&#x2019;d gotten my name from the classified directory. For someone like myself with an independent bent, self-employment seems to work out a lot better than punching a time clock and trying to look busy when the boss walks in. I never bitch about the boss, because I am he; I never have to worry about layoffs, because I am the sole employee of Milan Security, as well as the entrepreneur. So I didn&#x2019;t have to check with anyone before arranging a meeting with Hippsley-Tate that evening. And since I get to the West Side all too infrequently, I decided not to waste the trip. I invited my lady, Mary Soderberg, to join me for the evening and dinner at Johnny&#x2019;s.</p> <p>I picked her up at her place in Shaker Heights, and we headed out the Shoreway to the West Side. In a pair of black slacks and a shiny green blouse that did funny things to the normal blue of her eyes, she looked merely sensational, causing heads to turn everywhere we went. She knew the outfit was one of my favorites, and I was touched that she wanted to wear it for me. In fact, just about everything Mary did touched me one way or another. I was getting scared about Mary&#x2015;she was beginning to mean too much to me.</p> <p>Mary regarded the rough-hewn scenic wonders of downtown Cleveland as we swung by Municipal Stadium and approached the bridge. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t going to be one of those deals where you get hurt again, is it, Milan?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I hate it when you get hurt.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not real fond of it myself,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;When it comes to that, the whole idea is to hurt the other guy.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t General Patton say something like that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He never said it to me.&#x201d;</p> <p>The big-shouldered silhouette of the Lake Shore Hotel rose against the darkening sky on our right as I pulled off the Shoreway and started down the access road. It was a beautiful hotel, some fourteen stories high, covering almost two hundred acres of prime lake frontage. Beautiful, that is, if you like stark modern architecture done in grays and muted pinks. Me, I prefer the solid buildings that have been around for a while&#x2015;the ones that proudly announce they&#x2019;re from the Midwest: Terminal Tower, Gray&#x2019;s Armory, St. John&#x2019;s Cathedral, and the old Deming Mansion, which climbs the bluff just a few blocks from my apartment at the intersection of Cedar Road and Fairmount Boulevard. Then again, I like big band music and American cars and Beeman&#x2019;s gum and day baseball on grass, so you can&#x2019;t go by my tastes.</p> <p>The entire effect was as cold and emotionless as the eyes of a doll. Glass elevators climbed up the outside of the building like glossy-backed beetles, mirrored glass reflected the colors of the evening sky as though bent on improving them, and there was a too noisy waterfall in the lobby. For the life of me I couldn&#x2019;t find a ninety-degree angle anywhere in the hotel. The walls of the lobby were covered with a kind of carpeting, and curved, as if they had been photographed with a fish-eye lens. The only thing square was the Muzak chirping merrily from hidden speakers all over the place. I asked at the desk for Mr. Hippsley-Tate. The clerk, a perky nineteen-year-old girl wearing a gray blazer with the hotel&#x2019;s name and crest on the pocket, pointed me across the lobby to the executive offices.</p> <p>Mary said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll meet you in the cocktail lounge, or whatever they call that place with the tables by the waterfall. I don&#x2019;t want to sit there in the office like a camp follower while you play detective.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I hate to tell you this,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m not playing.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mary didn&#x2019;t understand about my work sometimes. Our relationship, now six months old, was basically hassle free. We hardly ever argued about anything, and when we did it was more of a spirited discussion than an argument. But she didn&#x2019;t always understand about my work, and it troubled me. One of these days I felt it would cause a problem.</p> <p>Richardson Hippsley-Tate&#x2019;s secretary was supercilious and curt, as if I were a pencil salesman come to foist some low-priced soft-lead specials on her boss. I guess when your hairspray is laid on as thick as hers was it cuts off circulation to your head, and you tend to snap at people as a matter of course. Eventually she relented, performed some sort of mystical ritual with the intercom system, and the man himself came out of his office to greet me. Hippsley-Tate was a stocky five foot eleven, and affected a dashing Continental-style Vandyke that matched his sandy hair. His expensive three-piece suit was of the same shade of gray as the carpeted walls. It must have been the corporate color. His handshake was firm and hearty.</p> <p>&#x201c;Come on in, Mr. Jacovich. It&#x2019;s so nice to meet you,&#x201d; he said, seeming almost puppyish in his desire to have me like him. &#x201c;How about some coffee? A drink? Name it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Nothing right now, thanks,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on my way to dinner. How can I help you, Mr. Hippsley-Tate?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Richie,&#x201d; he corrected me, indicating a comfortable chair for me to sit in. &#x201c;My last name&#x2019;s too much of a mouthful.&#x201d; He sat down behind his desk and folded his hands very correctly in front of him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get right to the point. Does the name Gregory Shane mean anything to you?&#x201d;</p> <p>I frowned. It did ring a bell somewhere, but I couldn&#x2019;t place it at first and told him so.</p> <p>&#x201c;How about North Coast Magazine?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I seem to remember them,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re new, just starting up. In fact, they called me for an ad about four months ago, but I wasn&#x2019;t interested. The guy I talked to&#x2015;was that Gregory Shane? A hell of a salesman. He said he&#x2019;d write a small article about my business and do a quarter-page ad for two hundred dollars.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Two hundred dollars,&#x201d; Hippsley-Tate murmured.</p> <p>&#x201c;It seemed like a good deal at the time, although now that you mention it, I haven&#x2019;t seen the magazine anywhere.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There is no magazine,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I imagine that Shane told you the magazine was designed to highlight members of the business community here in the Cleveland area, right? And that instead of simply buying ads, the businesses were, in effect, buying editorial space: the stories that would be written about them would be twice as efficient as just an ad.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Something like that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what happened to me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It was about two weeks before our grand opening in May. I&#x2019;d had meetings with the financial interests in this hotel, and it was my idea to bring some of the local people in here to dine and drink and dance, to attract business meetings and conventions from the immediate area as well as the out-of-town trade that obviously will keep up the occupancy rates. I&#x2019;m not worried about the transient business, but it&#x2019;s very important to me to keep our banquet and F and B divisions in the black.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;F and B?&#x201d;</p> <p>He smiled. &#x201c;Sorry. Food and beverage. So anyways, I was, making that a priority. And when Dan Mulkey called to ask for an appointment and told me about his magazine, it seemed to be just what I was looking for in terms of local publicity.&#x201d;</p> <p>I took out my notebook and jotted down two things. One of them was Dan Mulkey and the other was Anyways???? I said, &#x201c;Who is Dan Mulkey?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He was involved with the magazine somehow. He set up an appointment with me. They promised me that for the first three issues they wouldn&#x2019;t accept any advertising from any of the other hotels in town, like the Hyatt or the Hollenden House. In other words, the Lake Shore had an exclusive with North Coast, for the back cover, which is the most desirable place to put an ad, as you know.&#x201d;</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;d never advertised in my life. I said, &#x201c;And the cost of this ad?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Forty-two grand.&#x201d; I noticed that he was perspiring. General managers of luxury hotels weren&#x2019;t supposed to sweat. Under my other notations I put 42 Grand??</p> <p>Hippsley-Tate ducked his head. &#x201c;It was quite a price, but it was a new magazine and it was bound to get a lot of attention. I figured it was well worth it. Three-color printing, and they&#x2019;d do all the layout and typesetting.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What did they tell you in terms of readership?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They said they were aiming for a circulation of a hundred thousand. I mean, they were going to do a print run of twenty thousand, but he figured at least five people would see each issue. In doctors&#x2019; offices and hotel rooms and places like that, he said. And of course on the racks in all the markets and discount drug outlets and the bookstores.&#x201d; The perspiration had begun to collect over his eyebrows and he wiped at it absently with his hand. &#x201c;And they promised to give good reviews to our restaurants and to mention whatever entertainment we had in the lounges in later issues.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And you gave them the entire fee up front?&#x201d;</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;With amounts that large isn&#x2019;t it customary to spread payments out over longer periods?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Usually, sure. But when Dan Mulkey came to pick up the money he said the only way he could give me such a good rate was if he got a lump sum in advance.&#x201d; He pounded his desk gently with a knotted fist. &#x201c;I realize now what he was up to, but like I said, it seemed like such a good deal at the time.&#x201d;</p> <p>I scribbled Like I said?? Richardson Hippsley-Tate was beginning to interest me. &#x201c;When is the last time you heard from them?&#x201d;</p> <p>He held his hands up in a gesture of supplication. &#x201c;The day he picked up the money.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Did you get any sort of a receipt?&#x201d;</p> <p>He got up and went to a file cabinet in the corner. Ruffling through the folders for a moment, he came up with a piece of paper, which he brought to me. It was a standard receipt form, printed cheaply on thin paper, with Dan Mulkey&#x2019;s signature scrawled almost illegibly across the bottom. It said, &#x201c;Three issues, back pg., 3-color,&#x201d; and the date and the dollar amount. Across the top of the receipt was printed the name of the magazine and an address in Ohio City.</p> <p>&#x201c;Listen, Mr. Jacovich,&#x201d; he said, going to sit at his desk again. &#x201c;Can I call you Milan? Jacovich is almost as much of a mouthful as Hippsley-Tate.&#x201d;</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;The owners of this hotel are very upset about this, and I&#x2019;m kind of on the line about it. I mean, I cut this deal without going to executive row for approval. You&#x2019;ve got to help me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What do you want me to do?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Find Greg Shane and get our money back.&#x201d;</p> <p>I noted the use of the plural and lit a Winston. I didn&#x2019;t ask permission, because he was puffing away like mad on a cigarette of his own. He said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll give you a quarter of all the money you recover, with a minimum of five thousand dollars if you find Shane and don&#x2019;t recover the money right away.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And if I come up empty?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll pay you your standard daily rate and cover all your expenses for a week just for you to look. Is that fair?&#x201d;</p> <p>It was more than fair, and Richardson Hippsley-Tate knew it. But it didn&#x2019;t smell good to me. &#x201c;If you can&#x2019;t get the money back, why is it important for you to find Shane?&#x201d;</p> <p>He shrugged his shoulders. &#x201c;Everyone has assets that can be converted to cash. We&#x2019;ll get something out of it. Mainly, we don&#x2019;t want to look like a bunch of patsies.&#x201d;</p> <p>I wrote down patsies in my book. &#x201c;It seems to me that these people are bona fide con artists. Why don&#x2019;t you just put the police on them?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They came around and they took statements, but they are short on manpower, as usual, and right now they&#x2019;re looking into a real estate rip-off in Parma, where the sting is well over six figures. This case will die in the files, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d;</p> <p>He removed a wallet from his pocket and extracted a number of crisp one-hundred-dollar bills. It was the kind of flat wallet that didn&#x2019;t fold or crease the money inside; Benjamin Franklin was young and unwrinkled&#x2015;all fifteen of him. &#x201c;This should cover you for the first five days,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You can invoice me personally for the expense money.&#x201d;</p> <p>I took the money as though it might burn my fingers and put it in my jacket pocket. It felt bulky and unnatural there, like a tumor. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Tell me where to start.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There on the receipt is Shane&#x2019;s address. It&#x2019;s a house in Ohio City, and I can tell you right now that it&#x2019;s empty. He cleared out of there lock, stock, and wife.&#x201d; Hippsley-Tate pushed a piece of paper across the desk at me. It was a list of names and addresses.</p> <p>&#x201c;Who are these people?&#x201d;</p>...</p><h2>Three Women in a Mirror</h2><p>Anna, Hanna, and Anny. Three young women, free spirits all, each one at odds with the age in which they live. Despite the centuries that divide them, their stories intersect&#x2014;a surprising narrative technique that lends increasing tension and richness to this novel, which builds to a thrilling crescendo of unexpected revelations.<br><br>Anne lives in Flanders in the sixteenth century. She&#x2019;s a mystic who talks with animals like Saint Francis; she finds God in nature and cannot understand the need for religious rituals. Yet her ideas run against the temper of the times. It is the age of the counterreformation and the Inquisition. Her serenity and the loose tongues of those who secretly envy her, result in her being branded a heretic, with tragic consequences. Hanna lives in Vienna at the start of the twentieth century. She is a young noblewoman, dissatisfied with bourgeois conventions, who undertakes a journey of self-discovery. After much sadness she will find a method for uncovering the roots of her malaise in a new cure developed by a Viennese doctor by the name of Sigmund Freud. Anny is a Hollywood star of the 2000s. Addicted to celebrity and to variety of illicit substances she is searching for meaning in world where the only apparent thing of any value is money. Both her curse and her solace, acting will give her the key to a open a new chapter in her life where she will find love, companionship, and the meaning she has been searching for.</p><p>Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, playwright, novelist, and author of short stories, was awarded the French Academy&#x2019;s Grand Prix du Th��tre in 2001.

Buddy was a frequent Rockwell model, and was best friends with the Rockwell sons. It is the poignant story of two families tied by life and friendship in rural Vermont in the 1930s and 1940s, and the man who America regards as the pre-eminent 20th Century American artist. This book was written with the full support of the Norman Rockwell Family and the Norman Rockwell Family Agency, the only book written to date by a non-family member to accurately reflect the life that Norman Rockwell lived and captured in his art during the most prolific time of his career. Beautifully written by co-authors James &#34;Buddy&#34; Edgerton and Nan O&#39;Brien, &#34;The Unknown Rockwell&#34; contains personal family photographs of both families, as well as Rockwell&#39;s modeling photos and his illustrations that resulted. The Foreword is written by the legendary Dick Clark.</p><p></p><h2>American Dragons: Twenty-five Asian American Voices</h2><p><p>The dragon, a symbol of Asian art and mythology, appears in many guises and is always adaptable -- a survivor par excellence. Asian Americans display this same supple strength as they move between their Asian culture and their American one.</p><p>In <i>American Dragons</i>, Laurence Yep brings together twenty-five talented writers, each with a different story about the Asian American experience:</p><p>- A Chinese American girl struggles to find her place in a suburban high school without denying her true intelligence.</p><p>- A young woman is torn when her romantic feelings clash with the expectations of her Vietnamese parents.</p><p>- A twenty-first-century teenager and his aging grandfather learn that it is possible to live in the future without losing touch with the past.</p></p><p>Laurence Yep is the author of <i>The Imp That Ate My Homework</i>. He received Newbery Honors in 1975 for <i>Dragonwings</i> and in 1994 for <i>Dragon's Gate</i>.Mr. Yep lives in Pacific Grove, California."If there is one animal that is synonymous with Asian mythology and art--and the heart--it is the dragon," writes Yep ( The Rainbow People , Drag on wings ), who adds that when Asians came to America, "these dragons left their tracks as they wandered into . . . that vast psychological wilderness created by the American Dream." His enlightening anthology of 25 stories, poems and essays by Asian Americans delves deeply, examining the inner lives of young people with roots in Japan, China, India, Korea and Southeast Asia. Selections are set in the past and future as well as in the present, and nearly all raise questions about identity as protagonists choose to preserve or reject the values of their ancestors. For example, in "Who's Hu?" by Lensey Namioka, a Korean math wiz discovers that being true to herself is more important than gaining popularity by playing the role of an all-American girl. In "Rain Music," Longhang Nguyen traces the emotional pain of a Vietnamese girl who fulfills her parents' dream instead of her own desires. Relationships between adolescents and their parents, grandparents and peers remain a central focus throughout this volume. Arranged thematically in five sections accompanied by brief and eloquent commentaries by the editor, these writings speak to both Asian Americans and the general population; accordingly, they preserve and promote tolerance for minority cultures.

My judgment is preliminary and subject to review in the first instance by the Court of Pleas. However, an immediate decision is required because of the claim by UNAS that irreplaceable documents and artifacts are being lost forever, citing the routine use of the contents of the Rubbish Tips of Paradise as toilet paper by the nomadic tribes that frequently pass through the site.</p><p>The facts of this case are not in dispute and are as follows: This litigation has its origins in the first landing on the moon by Captain Victoria Ung Khanan some thirty years ago. That within days Captain Khanan discovered she had been beaten to this greatest of all firsts by some 165,000 years was as great a shock, perhaps, as has ever been delivered to WoMankind. The fragile remnants of what must have been an even more fragile spacecraft revealed that it had its origins in a vanished terrestrial civilization we knew nothing about, a civilization which soon became known as the Flag People, after the starred and striped insignia planted next to the craft. As a result, the Unified Nations Archaeological Survey was founded with the sole purpose of searching for evidence of the Flag People on earth itself.</p><p>So far this search has proved fruitless and for one simple reason: ice. UNAS quickly discovered that 164,000 years ago a period of major glaciation, now known as the Snowball, covered nearly the entire planet in ice, often to a depth of several miles. Ice that brings low vast mountain ranges has little problem removing the veneer of even the most complex civilization&#x2014;clearly only the smallest rump of the population could have survived. Further investigation, however, revealed a later and significant period of warming during the Snowball, which for fifteen thousand years caused the ice to retreat far enough and long enough for new civilizations to emerge, before they in turn were swallowed up by the returning ice.</p><p>It is at this point in this frustrating story that Paul Fahrenheit emerged to criticize, to put it at its mildest, his colleagues for their obsession with technological solutions to this great problem. He pointed out that trying to find such whispry traces of the past was like &#x201c;looking for hay in a haystack&#x201d; unless they used &#x201c;some mechanism&#x201d; to guide the technology. The &#x201c;mechanism&#x201d; likely to prove most effective in narrowing down the haystack, he argued, was that of legend and folk story. He claimed that real historical events from the distant past could become embedded in what were apparently entirely imaginary stories of gods and monsters and other fantastical tales. His ideas were dismissed out of hand and the relationship between Fahrenheit and his colleagues and superiors at UNAS became what could only be called vituperative.</p><p>As a result, in the Ventose of Republican Era 139, Paul Fahrenheit left UNAS in pursuit of what to his colleagues was the very definition of a wild-goose chase&#x2014;in search of what the isolated Habiru people called the Rubbish Tips of Paradise. It was here Mr. Fahrenheit thought he might be able to find the first terrestrial evidence if not of the Flag People then of the civilizations that briefly followed.</p><p>Four years after Paul Fahrenheit&#x2019;s disappearance the first volume of a &#x201c;fantasy&#x201d; fiction trilogy entitled <i>The Left Hand of God</i> was published. It was widely translated into some twenty-six languages but its reception by both audiences and critics was highly polarized: it was greatly admired by some but much disliked by others for its peculiar tone and odd approach to the art of storytelling. How are these two apparently unrelated events connected? It turns out that Mr. Fahrenheit was behind the publication of <i>The Left Hand of God </i>and a subsequent volume, <i>The Last Four Things</i>. These books were very far from the contemporary works of escapist fantasy they were presented as. As it happens, Fahrenheit&#x2019;s belief in the potential of the Rubbish Tips of Paradise was entirely on the mark. To cut a long and bitter story short, Fahrenheit took it into his head not to tell his former employer of his discovery, as he was legally bound to do. Instead, he claimed UNAS would, and I quote, &#x201c;smother the undoubted brilliance of what I have called <i>The Left Hand of God</i> trilogy in a dreary academic translation worked over by an army of self-serving pedants who would bury its vitality under a layer of high-minded dullness, footnotes and incomprehensible and obscurantist analysis.&#x201d;</p><p>Fahrenheit became obsessed with his belief that the modern world should confront these three books in something of the way their original audience might have confronted them. As a result, he took it upon himself to translate them (a considerable intellectual feat recognized even by his detractors) and have them published under his mother&#x2019;s family name as the above contemporary works of fiction. Who knows how long this curious subterfuge might have worked were it not for Mr. Fahrenheit&#x2019;s indiscreet pillow talk with a young woman, who, it turned out, was not as trustworthy as he believed and who promptly sold the story to a news tablet, which in turn led to UNAS applying to this court for an injunction putting the Rubbish Tips of Paradise under their legal control.</p><p>The Unified Nations Archaeological Survey is granted, as requested, complete but temporary control over the site.</p><p>However, its suit to prevent the publication of the final &#x201c;novel&#x201d; in the <i>Left Hand of God</i> trilogy, <i>The Beating of His Wings</i>, in a translation by Paul Fahrenheit, is denied. Publication may proceed under the condition that the summary of this judgment is printed at the beginning of <i>The Beating of His Wings</i>. Both UNAS and Paul Fahrenheit are given leave to add an appendix at the conclusion of the work in which they may explain their positions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>PART ONE</p><p>I came alone and I go as a stranger. I do not know who I am, or what I have been doing.</p><p>Aurangzeb</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p><b>A brief report on Thomas Cale, Lunatic. Three conversations at the Priory on the Island of Cyprus.</b></p><p><i>(NB This appraisal took place after Mother Superior Allbright&#x2019;s stroke. The notes she filed have been mislaid along with Cale&#x2019;s admission details. This report needs to be read in the light of this absence and so I will not be held liable for any of my conclusions.)</i></p><p>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</p><p>Medium stature, unusually pale. Middle finger of his left hand missing. Depression fracture to the right side of his skull. Severe keloid scar tissue in wound in left shoulder. Patient says he experiences intermittent pain from all injuries.</p><p>SYMPTOMS</p><p>Severe retching, usually in midafternoon. Exhaustion. Suffers insomnia and bad dreams when able to sleep. Loss of weight.</p><p>HISTORY</p><p>Thomas Cale suffers no hysterical delusions or uncontrolled behavior beyond that of his sour nature. His midafternoon retching leaves him speechless with exhaustion, after which he sleeps. By late evening he is able to talk, although he is the most sarcastic and wounding of persons. He claims to have been bought for sixpence from parents he does not remember by a priest of the Order of the Hanged Redeemer.</p><p>Thomas Cale is droll, not his least irritating affectation, and always tries either to make his interlocutor unsure as to whether he is mocking them or, by unpleasant contrast, to make it abundantly clear that he is. He tells the story of his upbringing in the Sanctuary as if daring me to disbelieve the daily cruelties he endured. Recovering from an injury which caused the dent in his head he claims&#x2014;again it is not possible to tell with what degree of seriousness&#x2014;that his already great prowess (he seems boastful in hindsight, but not at the time) was greatly increased as a result of the injury and that since this recovery he is always able to anticipate in advance any opponent&#x2019;s movements. This sounds unlikely; I declined his offer of a demonstration. The rest of his story is as improbable as the most far-fetched children&#x2019;s story of derring-do and swashbuckling. He is the worst liar I have ever come across.</p><p>His story briefly. His life of deprivation and military training at the Sanctuary came to a dramatic end one night after he accidentally came upon a high-ranking Redeemer in the middle of performing a live dissection upon two young girls, some kind of holy experiment to discover a means to neuter the power of women over mankind. Killing that Redeemer in the ensuing struggle, he escaped from the Sanctuary with the surviving young woman and two of his friends, with more Redeemers in vengeful pursuit. Evading their pursuers, the quartet ended up in Memphis, where, plausibly, Thomas Cale made many enemies and (rather less plausibly) a number of powerful allies, including the notorious IdrisPukke and his half brother, Chancellor Vipond (as he then was). Despite these advantages his violent nature asserted itself in a brutal but unusually nonfatal altercation with (so he says) half a dozen of the youths of Memphis in which (of course) he emerged triumphant but bound for prison. Nevertheless, Lord Vipond again mysteriously intervened on his behalf and he was sent into the countryside with IdrisPukke. The peace of the Materazzi hunting lodge where they were staying was interrupted shortly after he arrived by a woman who attempted to assassinate him, for reasons he was unable to clarify. His murder was prevented not by his own wonderful abilities&#x2014;he was swimming naked at the time of the attack&#x2014;but by a mysterious, unseen and insolent stranger who killed his would-be assassin by means of an arrow in the back. His savior then vanished without explanation or trace.</p><p>By now the priests of the Sanctuary had discovered his general whereabouts and attempted to flush him out (he claims) by kidnapping Arbell Materazzi, daughter of the Doge of Memphis. When I asked him why the Redeemers would risk a ruinous war with the greatest of all temporal powers for his sake, he laughed in my face and told me he would reveal his magnificent importance to me in due course. The inflated mad, in my experience, take their importance most seriously but it is a feature of Thomas Cale that his demented state only becomes apparent a few hours after a conversation with him comes to an end. While you are in his company even the most implausible stories he tells cause you to suspend disbelief until several hours later, when a most irritating sensation creeps over you, as if you had been tricked by a marketplace quack into parting with ready money for a bottle of universal remedy. I&#x2019;ve seen this before in a lunatic, though rarely, in that some are so powerfully deluded and in such a strange way that their delusions run away with even the most cautious of anomists.</p><p>Of course, Thomas Cale rescues the beautiful princess from the wicked Redeemers but, it must be said, not by means of the fair and noble fight against overwhelming odds but by stabbing most of his opponents in their sleep. This is another unusual feature of his delusion&#x2014;that each one of his endless triumphs is not generally achieved by heroism and noble audacity but through brutal trickery and conscienceless pragmatism. Usually such madmen present themselves as gallant and chivalrous, but Thomas Cale freely admits to poisoning his enemies&#x2019; water with rotting animals and killing his opponents in their sleep. It&#x2019;s worth recording briefly one of our exchanges in this regard.</p><p>ME</p><p>Is it a matter of course with you that you always kill unarmed prisoners?</p><p>PATIENT</p><p>It&#x2019;s easier than killing armed ones.</p><p>ME</p><p>So you believe the lives of others are a matter for sarcasm?</p><p>PATIENT (NO REPLY)</p><p>ME</p><p>You never consider showing mercy?</p><p>PATIENT</p><p>No, I never did.</p><p>ME</p><p>Why?</p><p>PATIENT</p><p>They wouldn&#x2019;t have shown it to me. Besides, what would I do but let them go only to find I&#x2019;d have to fight them again? Then I might become their prisoner&#x2014;and be killed myself.</p><p>ME</p><p>What about women and children?</p><p>PATIENT</p><p>I never killed them deliberately.</p><p>ME</p><p>But you&#x2019;ve killed them?</p><p>PATIENT</p><p>Yes. I&#x2019;ve killed them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He claimed to have built a camp to sequester the wives and children of the Folk insurrection and that because of his having been removed elsewhere almost the entire cantonment of five thousand souls died through famine and disease. When I asked him what he felt about this he replied: &#x201c;What should I feel?&#x201d;</p><p>To return to his story. After his brutal rescue of the beautiful Arbell Materazzi (are there any merely plain princesses in the world of the delusional?) he was promoted, along with his two friends, to guard the young woman toward whom he maintained throughout our three long conversations a deeply held resentment as to her ingratitude and disdain for him. This bitterness seems to hold a great sway over him because of his belief that when Memphis later fell to the Redeemers, it did so because the Materazzi failed to execute his plan to defeat them. (He is, by the way, very insistent that his skill in generalship is greater even than his talent for personal savagery.)</p><p>Usually sarcastic and matter-of-fact as he boasts of his great rise to power&#x2014;again, his droll tone makes it seem not like boasting until one reflects upon his claims in tranquillity&#x2014;he became most indignant as he recounted the way in which he was caught by the Redeemers after the Battle of Silbury Hill (certainly a disaster for us all whether or not Thomas Cale was involved). It is possible he was caught up in the battle in a minor way; his description of the events there has the note of real experience. Like all skilled romancers he can use his actual events to make the imagined ones truly plausible. For example, he frequently expresses repentance for any noble or generous actions he has performed. He says that he risked his life to save a Materazzi youth who had bullied and tormented him&#x2014;an act of sanctity which he says he now bitterly regrets. When I asked whether it was always bad to act generously toward others, he said that in his experience it might not be bad but it was always a &#x201c;bloody catastrophe.&#x201d; People thought so well of doing good, he said, that in the end they always decided it should be done at the end of a sword. The Redeemers thought so highly of goodness they wanted to kill everyone including themselves and start again. It turns out that this was the reason his former mentor, Redeemer Bosco, wanted him back at any price.

Like his earlier <i>Red Dragon</i>, the book takes us inside the world of professional criminal investigation. All the elements of a well-executed thriller are working here--driving suspense, compelling characters, inside information, publicity-hungry bureaucrats thwarting the search, and the clock ticking relentlessly down toward the death of another young woman. What enriches this well-told tale is the opportunity to live inside the minds of both the crime fighters and the criminals as each struggles in a prison of pain and seeks, sometimes violently, relief.<p> Clarice Starling, a precociously self-disciplined FBI trainee, is dispatched by her boss, Section Chief Jack Crawford, the FBI's most successful tracker of serial killers, to see whether she can learn anything useful from Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Lecter's a gifted psychopath whose nickname is "The Cannibal" because he likes to eat parts of his victims. Isolated by his crimes from all physical contact with the human race, he plays an enigmatic game of "Clue" with Starling, providing her with snippets of data that, if she is smart enough, will lead her to the criminal. Undaunted, she goes where the data takes her. As the tension mounts and the bureaucracy thwarts Starling at every turn, Crawford tells her, "Keep the information and freeze the feelings." Insulted, betrayed, and humiliated, Starling struggles to focus. If she can understand Lecter's final, ambiguous scrawl, she can find the killer. But can she figure it out in time? <i>--Barbara Schlieper</i></p>Praise for <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>: <p>"A virtual textbook on the craft of suspense.

A. Tittle<i><b> </b></i>sheds new light on both the memorable performances he achieved as a football player and the trials and tribulations he faced as he came so close to winning that elusive NFL championship. As the AAFC Rookie of the Year, seven-time Pro Bowl selection, four-time All-NFL selection and two-time NFL MVP, the Hall of Fame quarterback certainly holds an incredible individual record of excellence. With his notable humble personality, Tittle lays it all on the line and shares stories and insights about behind-the-scenes moments in the clubhouses and what goes on between teammates as they played together for months at a time each season. From his days as a youth in Marshall, Texas, to a brilliant football career with the LSU Tigers, Baltimore Colts, San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants to his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, talented quarterback Y.A. Tittle's love of football is what made him a legend.</p><p>Before cable television, artificial turf, multimillion-dollar contracts, and "Are You Ready for Some Football?" pro football players&#x2019; lives were not much different from those of the fans in the bleachers. Back in football&#x2019;s Golden Era, the game they played was much simpler but far tougher than anything seen today. Y.A. Tittle began his career in that simpler era, when players were expected to play both offense and defense and had to hold off-season jobs to make ends meet. Following a stellar career that lasted from 1948 until 1964, he retired from the game at 38 after starring for the Baltimore Colts, the San Francisco 49ers, and the New York Giants. Although he was the quarterback in the 49ers&#x2019; famous &#x201c;million dollar backfield,&#x201d; he is best remembered for his three years in New York and for his willingness to take the field when badly hurt. Y.A. took the Giants to three NFL Championship Games.<b>Y. A. Tittle</b> is a former professional football quarterback who played 10 seasons with the San Francisco 49ers and was traded to the New York Giants &nbsp;in 1961 where he was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player. In 1962 he played even better, with 33 touchdown passes and a career-high 3,224 yards. A year later, his touchdown stats went up to 36, he completed 60.2% of his passes, and again he was named NFL Player of the Year. <b>Kristine Setting Clark</b> is a feature writer for the San Francisco 49ers' and Dallas Cowboys' <i>Gameday</i> magazine.

United States troops on Wake Island were battling a Japanese landing force and, in the Philippines, losing the fight to save Luzon. In Japan, the Pearl Harbor strike force returned to Hiroshima Bay and toasted its sweeping success. Across the Atlantic, much of Europe was frozen in grim Nazi occupation.<p>Just three days before Christmas, Churchill surprised Roosevelt with an unprecedented trip to Washington, where they jointly lit the White House Christmas tree.

It's an aid readers will often turn to as the action-packed plot develops. Alfred, dubbed by history "the Great," succeeds to the kingdom of Wessex on the death of his beloved brother, Ethelred. He is aided in his struggle against the invading pagan Danes by his haughty young wife, Elswyth, of the kingdom of Mercia. As warrior-king, Alfred establishes a governmental system; as Latinist, he translates the poetry and classics that become the foundation of English literature; as a Christian he puts into practice the principles to which he was devoted. Around Alfred's magnificent defense of the English nation, Wolf ( Born of the Sun ) weaves convincing subplots of passionate love and betrayal that embellish the bare bones of history. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.In ninth century England King Alfred of Wessex gathered an army which permanently halted a Viking invasion that had devastated the country. For this, as well as his devotion to literature, he is known as Alfred the Great. This novel tells his story from childhood, through marriage to his beloved Elswyth, battles with the murderous Northmen, and finally his defeat of them in 878. It is unfortuante, though, that this rousing period in British history is treated in such a plodding, dull manner. Although the historical events are competently described, the passion and vibrancy that pervaded these times are completely missing.<br><i>- Patricia Altner, Dept. of Defense, Bolling AFB, Washington, D.C.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Rocketeer: The Complete Adventures</h2><p>Dave Stevens' high-soaring pulp-inspired character was an instant classic when first released.<br><br>Now, for the first time, all&nbsp;<i>The Rocketeer</i>&nbsp;stories by Stevens are collected in one edition&#x2013;and all meticulously remastered and re-colored&#x2013;bringing the complete death-defying adventures of Cliff Secord and company to a brand new audience!<br><br>Cliff Secord, a down-on-his luck pilot, is always looking for ways to make a fast buck.

This is the world of... The Rocketeer!</p><p>Dave Stevens was born in Lynwood, California on July 29, 1955. His career in comics began in 1975, assisting veteran artist Russ Manning on the syndicated <i>Tarzan </i>newspaper strip. Stevens went on to toil as a storyboard artist for Hanna-Barbara, DePatie-Freleng and Filmation animation studios, working on such programs as <i>Super Friends </i>and <i>The Godzilla Power Hour</i>. Later, Stevens was asked by Steven Spielberg to create presentation boards for <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>. During the same period, Stevens storyboarded the groundbreaking music video <i>Thriller </i>for Michael Jackson and did production design for Jackson&#x2019;s <i>Victory Tour</i>.&nbsp;<br><br> In 1982, Stevens debuted the feature for which he is best known, <i>The Rocketeer</i>. Initially appearing as a back-up feature in the second issue of an independent comic, the pulp-inspired story of Cliff Secord, a daring stunt pilot who finds an experimental rocket pack, became an instant sensation. The Rocketeer went on to star in his own comic book series, and in 1991 would become a well-received major motion picture from Walt Disney Studios.&nbsp;<br><br>Stevens&#x2019; lush figure work, particularly when rendering the female form, coupled with his elegant brush line, brought him much acclaim far&nbsp;beyond the confines of comic books. In particular, his breathy&nbsp;portrayals of Cliff&#x2019;s girlfriend Betty, inspired by famed pin-up queen Bettie Page, helped revitalize interest in the &#x2018;50s icon, a fact openly acknowledged by Page, who became close friends with Stevens in her final years.&nbsp;<br><br>On March 11, 2008, Dave Stevens lost a long battle against leukemia.Starred Review. Speeding across the sky like a jet-propelled dream, Stevens's Rocketeer is one of the most enduring and endearing images of '80s comics. Set in the '30s, these tales follow Cliff Secord, an impulsive young stunt pilot who finds a mysterious jetpack that enables him to fly. And then his troubles&#x2014;and the fun&#x2014;begin. A charming, lively tribute to the pulp era&#x2014;several characters from well-known pulp serials make clandestine appearances&#x2014;Stevens's lively, gorgeous art captures every wide-eyed gasp and clenched-jaw struggle of the breakneck tale. While Stevens, who died in 2008, is a master of adventure, Cliff's girlfriend Betty, a delightful homage to pinup queen Bettie Page, often steals the show. Due to Stevens's slow output, only a handful of Rocketeer stories exist, collected for the first time following a checkered publishing trail and being out-of-print for over a decade. Those who have never seen the complete Rocketeer will be satisfied with the regular hardcover edition; an oversized deluxe edition brings together concept art, sketches, and background materials that make this the definite record of one of comics' most appealing recent characters. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Arrogant and determined to always get his own way, he was much too sure of himself for Rosie's peace of mind.Yet he had also made it clear that he, too, had decided on the girl he wanted to marry...but did his plans include her? Only time would tell.</p><p>Romance readers around the world were sad to note the passing of Betty Neels in June 2001.Her career spanned thirty years, and she continued to write into her ninetieth year.To her millions of fans, Betty epitomized the romance writer.Betty&#x2019;s first book, Sister Peters in Amsterdam,was published in 1969, and she eventually completed 134 books.Her novels offer a reassuring warmth that was very much a part of her own personality.Her spirit and genuine talent live on in all her stories.The bright sunshine of early May, pouring through the latticed windows of the old house, shone on to the short dark curls of the girl bent over the case she was packing with a kind of controlled ferocity.<p>She was young, built on Junoesque lines, and tall with a lovely face and dark eyes heavily fringed with black lashes. The face was marred at the moment by her heavy frown.</p><p>'I cannot think what Granny is about,' she observed to the middle-aged lady&#x2014;an older, gently faded version of herself sitting and watching her. 'Mother, she is eighty years old; why on earth does she want to go trekking across the Highlands of Scotland...?'</p><p>'Not trekking, Rosie&#x2014;she won't have to move from the train if she doesn't wish to!' Mrs Macdonald heaved a sentimental sigh. 'I think it is rather touching that she should want to see the surroundings of her childhood.'</p><p>'Well, she won't see much from the train.' Rosie then added because of her mother's unhappy look, 'Well, if it makes her happy. But why me? There's Aunt Carrie...'</p><p>'Your granny and Aunt Carrie don't get on, dear. It is only for a week, and I dare say there will be some interesting people on the train.' She paused. 'Aren't you going to take the cream jersey? You look so nice in it, and it doesn't take up any room...</p><p>'Anyway, you never know,' continued her mother vaguely, and Rosie, guessing her parent's thoughts, said baldly,</p><p>'There will be Americans on the train, Mother, and possibly a German or two, all married and over fifty.'</p><p>'Oh, I do hope not,' said Mrs Macdonald. She had never quite understood why Rosie, at twenty-five, was still unmarried. She was as pretty as a picture, had any number of friends and, to her mother's knowledge, had turned down&#x2014;in the nicest possible manner&#x2014;several offers of marriage.</p><p>'Don't you want to get married?' she voiced her thoughts out loud.</p><p>'Oh, yes, Mother, dear. But I haven't met him yet..'</p><p>'There was that nice Percy Walls,' said Mrs Macdonald.</p><p>'Pooh!' replied Rosie strongly. 'He only talked about food and how clever he was. If I had married him I would have been a doormat, everlastingly cooking snacks.'</p><p>'He did like his food,' conceded Mrs Macdonald, 'but he was keen on you, darling.'</p><p>'Just because I can cook.' Rosie rolled up a pleated skirt in a ruthless fashion, and stuffed it into her case. 'Very surely being keen isn't enough, Mother. The man I marry must dote on me, cherish and love me for always, even when I'm bad-tempered or sneezing my head off.' She closed the case, and added briskly, 'I don't imagine there is such a man...'</p><p>'He sounds worth waiting for,' said Mrs Macdonald. 'I must admit that a man's love can be tried to the utmost when one has a heavy cold. Though I must say that your father is an exception.' She sounded a little smug, and Rosie laughed and dropped a kiss on her mother's cheek as she went to the dressing-table. 'Mother, Father is the nicest man I know. How much money shall I need to take, do you think?'</p><p>'Your granny said not to take any, but I think you had better take some; she forgets sometimes. Are you not looking forward to this trip at all, love?'</p><p>'Well, it will be nice to be in Scotland again, only a week isn't long enough&#x2014;I'd love to stay up in the Highlands for a long time, walk perhaps, or drive around. But I've only got two weeks' holiday, and Miss Porter wants to go away in June, so I'll have to be there to do some of her work.'</p><p>Rosie had spoken cheerfully; she disliked her job as a shorthand typist at Messrs Crabbe, Crabbe and Twitchett, the leading solicitors in the small country town in Wiltshire where she lived, but she had never said so; her father had lost almost all of his capital some years previously when the shares he held became almost worthless, and in order to keep his home in Scotland intact he had handed it over to a cousin and taken the job of agent on a large estate in Wiltshire. Neither he nor her mother had ever complained, although Rosie knew that they missed their home as much as she did. She had set about learning shorthand and typing, got herself a job, and consoled herself with the thought that their home in Scotland was, at least, still in the family.</p><p>Her grandmother lived in edinburgh with her unmarried daughter who was older than Rosie's father&#x2014;a wispy lady who was seldom able to complete a sentence, and was possessed of a meekness which irritated the old lady, a forceful person who browbeat her despite the care Aunt Carrie took of her. Rosie was able to see her very seldom; the journey to Scotland was expensive and long, and she suspected that her parents were reluctant to visit their old home now that her father's cousin lived there. Now she had been bidden to accompany the old lady on a train tour of the Highlands. 'To revive old memories,' her grandmother had said, and had explained her plan more fully by letter.</p><p>'I hear that the train is splendidly equipped and very well staffed. I shall not need to exert myself, but of course I need a companion. You will come with me, Rosie.'</p><p>'Of course you must go,' her father had observed. 'It will be a pleasant holiday for you; besides, it will give Carrie a week of peace and quiet.' He hadn't seen his sister for some time but he had vivid memories of his mother keeping her under her thumb. A week of freedom would do her good. So all the arrangements had been made; Rosie was to travel up to Edinburgh by train, spend the night at her grandmother's house, and escort her to the station on the following day. There wouldn't be many passengers, she had been told, and she had been sent the brochure so that she would have some idea what to expect. It had looked rather fun, and they would see many of the places she had known so well as a child, only she thought it unlikely that she would have much chance to poke around on her own. Granny had made it quite clear that she expected constant attention and companionship.</p><p>She and her mother went downstairs presently into the kitchen, and began to get supper while they argued amicably as to whether Rosie's jersey suit would be better than her lovat corduroy skirt and country shirt with her matching gilet over.</p><p>'It could be quite chilly still,' argued Mrs Macdonald. 'On the other hand the jersey is useful. I wish you could have had some new clothes.'</p><p>'No need&#x2014;I've got several thin tops with me, and I'll take the skirt and gilet. There's the shirtwaister if it gets really warm.'</p><p>Her father came in presently, and she went to lay the table in the small dining-room, seldom used, but this evening seemed a special occasion.</p><p>Her father drove her to the station the next morning in the rather battered Land Rover. He hadn't much to say; he was a quiet man, tall and thin and hardworking; he looked after the estate with the same care with which he had run his own family home in Scotland. Rosie wished with all her heart that he and her mother could have been coming with her; more than that she wished that they could go back to her home there. She sat up straighter; it did no good to repine. It would be nice to see Granny again even though she was a tartar; she listened carefully to her father's last-minute messages, kissed him goodbye, and got into the train.</p><p>'I'll be back in a week,' she told him. 'I'll phone and let you know which train I'll be on.'</p><p>Her grandmother had sent enough money for her fare and for a taxi to get her to King's Cross Station, and she joined the long queue. She was seldom in London, she didn't like it much, and she was glad when she finally reached the station with time to spare for coffee before she needed to get on to the train. It was more than six years since she had been at King's Cross; that was when they had left Scotland, and Rosie remembered how unhappy she had been. Her spirits lifted at the thought of going back, even if only for a week, and she got on to the train, found a corner seat, and prepared to while away the journey with a paperback until the train had left London and its suburbs, and begun its race to the north.</p><p>Waverley Station hadn't changed; it was in the heart of Edinburgh, and she gave an unconscious sigh of pleasure as she went in search of a taxi. Her grandmother lived on the other side of Princes Street, in a grey granite house, tall and narrow, one of a terrace of such houses in a narrow, winding street near Queen Street Gardens, surprisingly quiet although there was the constant hum of traffic from Princes Street and Queen Street. She got out of the taxi, and stood for a moment on the pavement looking up at her grandmother's house. It hadn't changed at all; there was the same solid door, the same dark green curtains at the narrow windows. She mounted the steps to the door and banged the knocker, and after a few moments it was partly opened by Elspeth, the elderly maid who had been with her grandmother ever since Rosie could remember.</p><p>She must be all of seventy, thought Rosie, embracing her warmly, but she seemed ageless, her iron-grey hair scraped back into a stiff bun, her bony frame erect in its black dress.</p><p>Elspeth led the way into the narrow hall, and opened a door. 'Yer granny's waiting. I'll leave ye a wee while before I bring in the tea.'</p><p>She gave Rosie a little push and shut the door on her. Old Mrs Macdonald was sitting bolt upright in a high-backed chair. She was an imposing figure, tall and stout with dark hair only lightly streaked with silver. She was handsome, with dark eyes and a straight nose above an obstinate mouth. She hadn't changed, thought Rosie, crossing the room to kiss her.</p><p>'You had a good journey?' asked her grandmother, the question uttered in a voice which expected no reply.

Pheidippides ran to neighboring Sparta, 140 miles away, to ask for the Spartans&#39; aid. Afterwards he sped back to the battle, where he helped defeat the enemy.</p><p>Susan Reynolds is an Albert Whitman author.Grade 3-5&#x2013;Twenty-five hundred years ago, a small band of Greeks faced the huge Persian army. Given the horrendous odds, help was a necessity, so a young runner named Pheidippides ran 140 miles to Sparta to request aid, and then ran back to report that the Spartans were on their way, albeit in their own good time. The boy stayed to help the Athenians defeat the Persians, and then ran to Athens to relate the news of the victory. Completely spent by his superhuman efforts, he collapsed and died&#x2013;but he left a legacy in the 26-mile race named after the battle he reported on. This rather heavily fictionalized picture-book recounting presents an engaging young hero in readable, if slightly gee whiz prose. The facts of the story, as they are known, are set out clearly within the context of a tale, and the book would read aloud quite well. Minters illustrations are reminiscent of Ashley Wolffs work, with the strong black outlines and blocks of solid color. The map of Greece and the Persian Empire on the endpapers is most helpful in laying a framework for the story. An afterword includes detailed information on the historical sources the author used to inform her story. A sound addition for most collections.<i>&#x2013;Ann Welton, Grant Elementary School, Tacoma, WA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His new novel, A KEEPER, is a twisted tale of secrets and ill-fated loves that once again demonstrates Norton&#39;s understanding of human nature and all its darkest flaws. The mystery of Elizabeth Keane&#39;s father is one that has never been solved by the people of Buncarragh - not for lack of speculation. Her mother Patricia had been assumed a spinster, until she began dating a mysterious man from out of town, and within months had left Buncarragh and had married. Less than two years later, Patricia was back, with a new baby in her arms, but no new husband by her side and unbendingly silent about her recent past. A secret she would take with her to her grave. Now, as Elizabeth returns to the village after her mother&#39;s funeral, bringing with her her own regrets and wounds, she finds a thin pile of ribbon-bound letters at the back of a wardrobe that may at last hold the key to her past: Dear Lonely Leinster Lady, I&#39;m not really sure how to begin...

In 1999 he became the first Children&#39;s Laureate. In 2005 he was awarded a CBE.Kindergarten-Grade 6-Believing that enjoyment of the art in picture books can be a prelude to pleasure in a museum, Blake designed an exhibit (with the same title as this book) at the National Gallery in London. The images in the show and on these pages come from European children's books and Great Britain's galleries and were chosen for their story potential. Blake's signature caricatures cavort and converse before and after each of the 26 pictures, modeling responses that invite imitation. His arrangement is alphabetical by artist, from Hendrick Avercamp to Lisbeth Zwerger. ("X," however, is an X ray of an underpainting, sure to fascinate since it is different from the surface.) Four pages are devoted to each entry. Initially, sketches of children, outlined in black and dabbed with gray/blue patches of color, carry signs that announce the artist's name. The spread that follows includes a blank, white page and then the featured art-a presentation that minimizes distraction. The fourth page provides the young visitors' emotional responses to the work. ("Nobody would buy that." "What do you think that music sounded like?") Most entries will be unfamiliar to American audiences, and some details are difficult to discern. As with any stroll through a museum, what strikes one's fancy is completely idiosyncratic. Blake's approach is an engaging path to art appreciation, with plenty of child appeal. The book concludes with illustrated and annotated attributions for each work and a list of locations/credits.

Website: robertwhitlow.com, Twitter: @whitlowwriter, Facebook: robertwhitlowbooks.</p><p><br> CHAPTER ONE:</p> <p> <b>K</b>ent "Mac" McClain checked the time on the grandfather clock that faced him impassively from the far corner of his walnut-paneled law office. The old clock was an antique inherited from his mother's side of the family and worked perfectly as long as the weights and chains were kept in proper tension. As a child, Mac would lie in bed and listen to the old clock's solemn announcement of each passing hour from its spot in the foyer of his parents' home. Many years later he cleared a place for it in the corner of his office; however, the clock's loud striking every quarter-hour disrupted meetings with clients, so Mac disabled the chiming mechanism. Now, except for a steady ticking, the ivory face with its large, black Roman numerals kept a silent, closed-lipped vigil.</p> <p>It was almost 5:00 p.m. In a few minutes the office staff would pass through the reception room door and go home for the weekend. He would be alone.</p> <p>His neatly combed brown hair was heavily streaked with gray, but Mac was in better than average physical shape for age fifty-six. Just under six feet, he only weighed twenty-five pounds more than when he graduated from law school at the University of Georgia, and he could still spend an afternoon hiking in the mountains east of Dennison Springs. But he couldn't take total credit for his good physical condition; it was genetic. </p> <p>He'd also inherited his father's dry wit and his mother's compassionate brown eyes. Mac still maintained his wit, now a facade he hid behind, but it had been a long time since he felt compassion for another's pain. He hadn't blinked away tears for someone else's sorrow in years. </p> <p>He heard the front door close and slowly poured a beer into the cold mug sitting on the corner of his desk. Except for Friday afternoons, he never drank at the office. Friday afternoons were different. On Fridays he didn't drink to mask the malaise he carefully concealed from the eyes of the world. Rather, he renewed a ritual from a happier time, a thirty-five-year-old tradition begun on crisp autumn Fridays during college days in Athens, Georgia. Mac lived in a fraternity house his senior year, and as soon as classes were finished for the week, he would take an iced mug from the refrigerator, carefully pour a beer, sit on the front porch in a rocking chair, and watch the traffic go by on Milledge Avenue. But today was different. Today was no celebration.</p> <p>His heart beating a little faster than normal, he opened the bottom left drawer of his desk and took out the Colt .45 pistol issued to his father during World War II. </p> <p>At the beginning of the war, the standard side arm for military officers was a six-shot Smith and Wesson .38 revolver, but the ferocity of the Japanese soldiers in the Pacific forced the American military to rethink its strategy. In close combat, a .38-caliber shell might wound a charging infantryman, but it did not have sufficient mass to knock him down. The arms makers answered with a more potent weapon, and when Mac's father made the shift from head of the trust department for a local bank to captain in the U.S. Army, he acquired the drab olive weapon that now rested on his son's desk.</p> <p>Mac snapped out the clip. One by one, he extracted the bullets and lined them up like polished sentries on the edge of the dark wood. Bullets were small objects that could have devastating and deadly effect, especially when fired directly into the human skull at close range.</p> <p>Opening the narrow middle drawer of the desk, he took out a bottle of prescription pain pills. In some ways, pills and bullets were remarkably similar. Of course, the pills were intended to relieve pain; bullets were designed to inflict it. But for Mac's purposes, bullets or pills would serve the same purpose-to end his suffering, once and for all. Mac shook the bottle. It was full. </p> <p>How many of the potent pain relievers would it take? Half a bottle? Three-quarters? It wouldn't be that difficult to take them all. And then what would happen? Dizziness? Sleepiness? Nothingness?</p> <p>Mac had not been able to decide which would be the best method of death-bullet or pill. Each had its advantages. There was something masculine about a bullet to the brain. Messy, but manly. Pills were more suitable for Hollywood starlets who discovered that bright lights and fame were just another path into the black hole of depression and despair. But pills were tidy; no hair need be disturbed, and whoever found him wouldn't have to deal with a horrific death scene. Mac's sense of decency and decorum argued for the pain relievers. His desire for swift certainty drew him toward one of the shiny metal sentinels. The issue remained undecided.</p> <p>The phone on his desk buzzed. Startled, he set down the pill bottle, knocking over some of the bullets.</p> <p>"Who is it?" he barked into the receiver.</p> <p>"Judge Danielson on line one," his secretary answered.</p> <p>Stepping back from the edge of the cliff, Mac brushed the bullets into his hand. "I'll take it, Judy. I thought you'd gone home."</p> <p>"I wanted to finish the first draft of the Morgan brief. I'll be going in a few minutes. Have a good weekend."</p> <p>"Uh, thanks. You, too."</p> <p>Mac punched the phone button. "Hello, Judge."</p> <p>"Glad I caught you before you started your weekend. Do you still have a cold one every Friday?"</p> <p>"I'm looking at it as we speak." Mac held the phone to his ear with his shoulder, snapped the clip back into the gun, and returned it to its place in the desk drawer.</p> <p>"Come over to the courthouse," the judge said. "I need to talk to you."</p> <p>"What is it?" he asked. "I'm off duty."</p> <p>"Just come. I'll explain when you get here." </p> <p>"Can it wait until Monday?" </p> <p>"No," the judge said simply.</p> <p>Mac sighed. "Give me five minutes."</p> <p>"Thanks. See you then."</p> <p>Mac put the phone receiver back in its cradle. His hands slightly sweaty, he held the pill bottle up between his fingers. He resented the interruption of the judge's call. He was getting closer to a verdict in the hidden trial raging within the dark brooding of his soul. Life or death. Bullet or pill. He knew he didn't have to go to the courthouse; he could continue the secret trial interrupted by the judge's call. But the spell was broken; the jury deciding his fate would have to continue its deliberations at a later date.</p> <p>Mac buttoned the top button on his shirt and straightened his silk tie. Grabbing a blank yellow legal pad, he locked the front door of the small, red-brick house he'd converted into an attractive law office and began the short walk to the courthouse. One of the advantages of practicing law in a town like Dennison Springs was convenience. The courthouse, the offices of the three major law firms, and two of the main banks were all close-by. Unless it was raining or bitter cold, he would often hand-deliver legal papers or go to the bank to make a deposit as an excuse to take a walk. </p><p>Mac knew every tree, stray blade of grass, and crack in the sidewalk along the way. He crossed the street and climbed the wide steps of the Echota County Courthouse. Built as a project of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Depression, the large, square, red-brick building with its silver domed roof would not win any architectural awards, but it had a certain crude charm. Surrounded on three sides by long rows of crepe myrtles, it was wreathed in purple for a few glorious months in late summer. </p><p>The ground floor contained the office for the clerk of court, the probate judge, and a large vault where the deed records were stored. Except when he had to go to the clerk's office to file papers, Mac rarely stayed on the first level of the building. Climbing the worn steps, he went upstairs to the main courtroom with its high ceiling and tall windows that provided a spectacular view of the southern Appalachians. Mac didn't need to "See Rock City," the mountaintop tourist trap in Chattanooga. He could take in the panorama of the mountains free of charge every time he went to court. During the past thirty years, he had witnessed every nuance of the changing seasons on the distant hills from the courtroom vantage point. This afternoon, the pale yellows, oranges, and reds of mid-October dominated the view. </p><p>The courtroom was laid out like a miniamphitheater. The floor sloped gradually downward from the back of the room to a level area where the jury box directly faced the elevated judge's bench and witness stand. When trying a case, the lawyers sat on opposite sides of the jury, and everybody had a clear view of those called to testify.</p> <p>Judge William L. Danielson was three years younger than Mac. Short and stocky, he was raised on a pecan farm in middle Georgia and moved to Dennison Springs after graduating from Mercer Law School in Macon. For the next fifteen years, he practiced corporate and commercial law as an associate and partner with one of the "big three," the law firms in town with more than five attorneys. During his years in private practice, Bill Danielson and Mac only squared off in court on one occasion. Mac won. </p><p>Judge Danielson's chambers were to the right of the bench where he presided. Mac walked into the office suite and knocked on the wooden frame of the open door. </p><p>"Come in and have a seat, Mac." The judge motioned toward a pair of wooden armchairs across from his light-colored oak desk. "I need your help." </p><p>Mac sat and waited. </p><p>Holding up a single sheet of paper, the judge said, "I'll get to the point. This is an order appointing you to represent Peter Thomason." </p><p>Mac's jaw dropped. "What! I haven't tried a major criminal case in years." </p><p>"I have a good reason-" </p><p>"Gene Nelson is public defender," Mac interrupted. "He handles these types of cases." </p><p>"Take it easy," the judge lifted his hand. "Gene called me an hour ago. He has a conflict. The pathologist from Atlanta who tested the defendant's blood for drugs is Gene's new brother-in-law. The man is certain to testify as an expert witness and will have to be cross-examined by Thomason's lawyer. If there is a conviction, I can't risk a habeas corpus from a smarty-pants lawyer down the road based on ineffective assistance of counsel." </p><p>"But why me?" Mac asked, slumping back in his chair. </p><p>"Because it involves the Hightower family," the judge said slowly. "Who else could do it?" </p><p>Mac didn't answer. Peter Thomason was charged with murder. But it wasn't a sordid domestic killing or the result of a botched drug deal. The victim was nineteen-year-old Angela Hightower, the only child of Alexander and Sarah Hightower, the most influential family in Dennison Springs. </p><p>A friend of Mac's once suggested that the Echota County Chamber of Commerce should sell bumper stickers that read, "Dennison Springs, Georgia. Owned and Operated by Hightower &amp; Co." Alex Hightower's ancestors were among the first settlers in the area after Andrew Jackson ordered the U.S. Army to remove the Cherokee Indians from northwest Georgia and march them along the "Trail of Tears" to Oklahoma in the 1830s. By 1880, the Hightower family had built the first textile mill, chartered the first bank, and controlled the First Methodist Church. During the next hundred years, their economic interests expanded beyond the boundaries of Dennison Springs, and the family moved seventy-five miles south to Atlanta. But they kept strong ties to the area and spent a month each summer at the family estate on the edge of town. Hightower money was the backbone of several major business ventures in the area, and no local lawyer in his right mind did anything to antagonize them. No lawyer, that is, except Mac. </p><p>"I see," Mac said. "You don't know a young lawyer who would take the case without caring about the consequences?" </p><p>"Do you?" the judge responded. </p><p>Mac mentally ran down the list of possibilities and shook his head. "None with any criminal defense experience." </p><p>"I can't appoint someone who's handled a few nolo pleas in traffic court to a murder case." </p><p>Mac shrugged. "It's been awhile. The last major criminal case I handled was-" </p><p>"State versus Jefferson," the judge interrupted. "Three and a half years ago. You tried the case for three days to a hung jury. The D.A.'s office decided to nol-pros the charges and turn him loose." </p><p>Mac suppressed a slight smile. "You didn't think he was guilty, either, did you?" </p><p>"No comment. My point is that under the Sixth Amendment Thomason deserves quality representation." </p><p>"And you don't want to jeopardize another young lawyer's career by asking him to defend the man who may have murdered the Hightowers' daughter." </p><p>"Right." The judge leaned forward and picked up the order. "Even though you're an officer of the court, I'm not going to make you do this." </p><p>Mac raised his eyebrows. "I can refuse?" </p><p>"Yes. Consider it over the weekend and call me Monday morning." </p><p>"Does Thomason know about the conflict of interest?" </p><p>"Gene Nelson is going to talk to him this evening." </p><p>"Fair enough." Mac got up to leave. "I'll let you know first thing on Monday." </p><p>"One other matter," the judge said. "I understand Alex Hightower has hired Joe Whetstone from Atlanta to act as special prosecutor." </p><p>"Really? Bringing in the big guns for the execution." </p><p>"It will be a challenge." </p><p>"And you think I want a challenge?" Mac asked. </p><p>The judge shook his head. "You don't have to prove anything to me, Mac." </p><p>Mac stepped to the open door. "Will the county pay for an investigator and expert witnesses?" </p><p>"Anything within reason. I'll try to get it for you." </p><p>Mac walked down the steps of the courthouse. He'd read articles about the murder in the local newspaper. It would be a difficult case to handle. The Hightowers would spare no expense to obtain a conviction. Hiring Joe Whetstone as special prosecutor was just one step. The Atlanta lawyer would be supported by a cadre of associates, an army of paralegals, and the best investigators and expert witnesses money could buy. </p><p>Forgetting about the bullets, the pills, and his beer, he crossed the street. With each step, the secret, dark thoughts of his own death retreated. Thoughts about another man whose life hung in the balance before the eyes of everyone in Echota County took their place. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Map of Love</h2><p>In 1900 Lady Anna Winterbourne travels to Egypt where she falls in love with Sharif, and Egyptian Nationalist utterly committed to his country&#39;s cause. A hundred years later, Isabel Parkman, an American divorcee and a descendant of Anna and Sharif, goes to Egypt, taking with her an old family trunk, inside which are found notebooks and journals which reveal Anna and Sharif&#39;s secret.</p><p>Ahdaf Soueif's <i>The Map of Love</i> is a massive family saga, a story that draws its readers into two moments in the complex, troubled history of modern Egypt. The story begins in 1977 in New York. There Isabel Parkman discovers an old trunk full of documents--some in English, some in Arabic--in her dying mother's apartment. Incapable of deciphering this stash by herself, she turns to Omar al-Ghamrawi, a man with whom she is falling in love. And Omar directs her in turn to his sister Amal in Cairo.<p> Together the two women begin to uncover the stories embedded in the journal of Lady Anna Winterbourne, who traveled to Egypt in 1900 and fell in love with Sharif Pasha al-Barudi, an Egyptian nationalist. To their surprise, they stumble across some unsuspected connections between their own families. Less surprising, perhaps, is the persistence of the very same issues that dogged their ancestors: colonialism, Egyptian nationalism, and the clash of cultures throughout the Middle East. The past, however, does offer some semblance of omniscience: </p><blockquote> That is the beauty of the past; there it lies on the table: journals, pictures, a candle-glass, a few books of history. You leave it and come back to it and it waits for you--unchanged. You can turn back the pages, look again at the beginning. You can leaf forward and know the end. And you tell the story that they, the people who lived it, could only tell in part. </blockquote> With its multiple narratives and ever-shifting perspectives, <i>The Map of Love</i> would seem to cast some doubt on even the most confident historian's version of events. Yet this subtle and reflective tale of love does suggest that the relations between individuals can (sometimes) make a difference. "I am in an English autumn in 1897," Amal confesses at one point, "and Anna's troubled heart lies open before me." Here, perhaps, is a hint about how we should read Soueif's staggering novel, using words as a means to travel through time, space, and identity. <i>--Vicky Lebeau</i>Booker Prize Finalist <br>"Sweeping and evocative--. An unconventional love story."--"The Times (London) <br>With her first novel, In the Eye of the Sun, Ahdaf Soueif garnered comparisons to Tolstoy, Flaubert, and George Eliot. In her latest novel, which was shortlisted for Britain's prestigious Booker Prize, she combines the romantic skill of the nineteenth-century novelists with a very modern sense of culture and politics--both sexual and international. <br>At either end of the twentieth century, two women fall in love with men outside their familiar worlds. In 1901, Anna Winterbourne, recently widowed, leaves England for Egypt, an outpost of the Empire roiling with nationalist sentiment. Far from the comfort of the British colony, she finds herself enraptured by the real Egypt and in love with Sharif Pasha al-Baroudi. Nearly a hundred years later, Isabel Parkman, a divorced American journalist and descendant of Anna and Sharif has fallen in love with Omar al-Ghamrawi, a gifted and difficult Egyptian-American conductor with his own passionate politics. In an attempt to understand her conflicting emotions and to discover the truth behind her heritage, Isabel, too, travels to Egypt, and enlists Omar's sister's help in unravelling the story of Anna and Sharif's love. <br>Joining the romance and intricate storytelling of A.S. Byatt's Possession and Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient, Ahdaf Soueif has once again created a mesmerizing tale of genuine eloquence and lasting importance.</p><h2>A Question Of Pride (Harlequin Presents, No 1140)</h2><p>Clea had been young and naive when Max Latham chose her from the typing pool to be his secretary and, later, his mistress.

Grandma Mazur's gambling partner, Eddie Dachooch, was found toes-up on his kitchen floor, dead from a shotgun blast. But when Grandma goes to the viewing, shoe doesn't recognize the man in the casket. She drags Stephanie along to find the missing dead body. But Stephanie's mind is on other matters because she has two proposals to consider: vice cop Joe Morelli is proposing marriage, and fellow bounty hunter Ranger is proposing a single perfect night...The seventh Stephanie Plum novel drops Stephanie into a smorgasbord of murder, kidnapping, and extortion as well as a sensuouse buffet of fast cars, fast men, and fast food.</p><p>Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum's got a lot on her mind. How does cigarette smuggler Eddie DeChooch, a fugitive so geriatric that even the hot-to-trot Grandma Mazur won't go out with him a third time, keep giving her the slip? How did a woman who died of a heart attack end up in DeChooch's garden shed with five bullet holes in her chest? Who stole a rump roast from Dougie and Mooner, the two lovable potheads who have decided to be crime fighters in Spandex bodysuits? Can Stephanie's perfect sister Valerie make it as a lesbian single mother without driving her family crazy? And--oh yeah--what should Stephanie do about that damn wedding dress on hold at Tina's Bridal Shoppe, waiting for her to decide whether vice cop Joe Morelli's really the one for her?<p> </p><blockquote>I <i>did</i> look good in the gown. I looked like Scarlett O' Hara getting ready for a big wedding at Tara. I moved around a little to simulate dancing.<p> "Jump up and down so we can see how it'll look when you do the bunny hop," Grandma said.</p><p> "It's pretty but I don't want a gown," I said.</p><p> "I can order one in her size at no obligation," Tina said.</p><p> "No obligation," Grandma said. "You can't beat that."</p><p> "As long as there's no obligation," my mother said.</p><p> I needed chocolate. A <i>lot</i> of chocolate. "Oh gee," I said, "look at the time. I need to go."</p></blockquote><p> To complicate matters further, Stephanie's made a reluctant deal with the devil: if she can't bring in DeChooch by herself, her sexy but dangerous cohort Ranger is willing to help--for a price that a girl who's not-exactly-engaged is uncertain whether she should pay. But when Dougie and Mooner disappear, Grandma is kidnapped, and a crazy widow starts taking pot shots, no one who hides her .38 in a cookie jar is going to turn down a little friendly assistance.</p><p> In <i>Seven Up</i>, Janet Evanovich serves up her usual bubbly fare: a totaled car, raucous viewings at Stiva's Funeral Parlor, buffoonish bad guys, and down-and-dirty mud wrestling, all stirred up with some snappy Jersey repartee and a few tart, new twists that will keep her fans impatient.

She has written about language, science, and culture for publications such as <i>The New Yorker, The New York Times, Scientific American, Discover</i>, and <i>Slate</i>.This book grows out of Kenneally's conviction that investigating the evolution of language is a good and worthwhile pursuit&#x2014;a stance that most in the field of linguistics disparaged until about 20 years ago. The result is a book that is as much about evolutionary biology as it is about linguistics. We read about work with chimpanzees, bonobos, parrots and even robots that are being programmed to develop language evolutionarily. Kenneally, who has written about language, science and culture for the <i>New Yorker</i> and <i>Discover</i> among others, has a breezily journalistic style that is occasionally witty but more often pragmatic, as she tries to distill academic and scientific discourses into terms the casual reader will understand. She introduces the major players in the field of linguistics and behavioral studies&#x2014;Noam Chomsky, Steven Pinker, Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and Philip Lieberman&#x2014;as well as countless other anthropologists, biologists and linguists. Kenneally's insistence upon seeing human capacity for speech on an evolutionary continuum of communication that includes all other animal species provides a respite from ideological declamations about human supremacy, but the book will appeal mainly to those who are drawn to the nuts and bolts of scientific inquiry into language. <i>(July 23)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the digital age, with its powers of instant recall and infinite reproduction, why are we witnessing an unprecedented revival of figurative painting? <br><br><em>A Brush with the Real</em> presents a survey of key contemporary artists who have each embraced painting and are working within a realist tradition. Through individual interviews the book peers into the life and work of each of these artists, discussing their methods, motives, and sources, from art history to the internet and the language of film. The book celebrates the work of 51 artists who are each taking the medium in a new direction: from those who work with appropriation and found images, to those trying to get as close as possible to contemporary reality and first-hand experience, to artists who are simply using painting as a door to parallel or imaginary worlds. <br><br>The book makes the argument that, since perhaps the early Renaissance, the role fulfilled by painting has never been so vital or timely: in our image-saturated culture, digital technology has given painting and its slow, full-resolution images a new lease of life.</p><p>Margherita Dessanay graduated from the University of Cagliari with a degree in the History of Art before studying for an MA in Contemporary Art Theory at Goldsmith's, University of London.

His books include <em>RGB: Reviewing Graphics in Britain</em>, <em>Walk the Line</em> and <em>Microworlds</em> (also with Margherita Dessanay).*Starred Review* In the age of smartphones, everyone is a photographer, and images are rampant. So why do artists still paint? Why do we still love to look at paintings? And why is figurative painting thriving all around the world? Valli and Dessanay address these questions with stimulating acuity, analyzing the power of the human touch and the humanizing eye. Unlike the throwaway images that incessantly come and go on our screens, paintings have presence and substance and deep roots in art history. The figurative tradition is attaining new levels of complexity and daring in the twenty-first century in dynamic response to the digital photo explosion. In this unique book&#x2019;s magnificent array of figurative paintings by 51 artists from around the world, each artist&#x2019;s comments about his or her work accompany multiple examples, all very recent, some painted from life, many appropriating mass media images, and others offering futuristic imaginings. Here are the French painter Guillaume Bresson&#x2019;s Tintoretto-inspired, intricately choreographed scenes of street violence; Australian Jeremy Geddes&#x2019; photorealist yet surreal paintings of astronauts falling into urban settings; the highly expressive sociopolitical portraits of Lebanese artist Ayman Baalbaki; the paintings of everyday life by Chinese painter Liu Xiadong; and American artist Amy Bennett&#x2019;s dramatic and mysterious landscapes.

Heir to the legendary Fontainebleau hotel, he spent his childhood surrounded by some of the world's biggest stars, including Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, Elvis Presley, and Ann-Margret, who performed regularly at the Fontainebleau's La Ronde Room. He sat by while his parents entertained presidents and movie stars, as they reigned over Miami Beach in the &#x2018;50's and &#x2018;60's, and when the family business went sour he became wealthy in his own right, founding a multi-million dollar business using connections he made at the Fontainebleau. <br>But Ben, Jr.'s luxurious, celebrity-studded lifestyle would end in another hotel room&#x2015;a thousand miles away from the one where he grew up&#x2015;when police found him bound up in duct tape, beaten to death. <br>Seven years earlier, police found Novack in an eerily similar situation&#x2015;when his wife Narcy duct-taped him to a chair for twenty-four hours and robbed him.

At its heart is a traditional love story-cum-family saga. Karim and Raheen are anagram-swapping "fated friends." Until the age of 13, when Karim moved to London, they were virtually raised as brother and sister. Their parents had once been engaged to each other. The unravelling of quite why this matrimonial square dance occurred is juxtaposed with Karim and Raheen's own, and decidedly more protracted, romance. <p> As the title suggests, mapping--geographical, political and emotional--is central to the book. The "comic" spelling is a wry allusion to its setting: the troubled Pakistani city of Karachi, a place that, as Karim observes, worships "at the altar of K." Karim, Raheen and their friends Sonia and Zia all belong to the privileged Karachi elite. Born on the right "side of the Clifton Bridge" they seem immune from Karachi's endemic corruption, violence, and religious and ethnic intolerance but they and their families, like the rest of the city's inhabitants, have all been horrifically scarred by events of the 1971 civil war.</p><p> Like Austen, or perhaps more accurately Forster, Shamsie is wonderfully adept at capturing the petty rivalries and social games of Pakistan's highly stratified bourgeoisie society--Zia's house is sagely described as "always full of people worth cultivating, rather than people worth having in your home." There are a few (well-acknowledged) nods to Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i> and even Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> gets a look in but Shamsie wears her learning lightly. She manages to make Karim and Raheen's journey to toward engagement, both with the realities of Karachi and with each other, into a profound meditation on the nature of love, storytelling and politics. <i>--Travis Elborough, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"[Shamsie] packs her story with the playful evidence of her high-flying intelligence." -- San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>Raised together from birth, Raheen and her best friend Karim dream each other's dreams and finish each other's sentences. They share an idyllic childhood in upper-class Karachi with parents who are also best friends, even once engaged to the other until they rematched in what they jokingly call "the fiancee swap." But when Karim's family migrates from Pakistan to London, distance and adolescence split the friends apart. Karim takes refuge in the rationality of maps while Raheen searches for the secret behind her parents' exchange. She uncovers a story not just of a family's turbulent history but that of a country -- and finds herself poised between strained friendship and fated love with Karim.<br><br>"This 30-year-old has been described as a young Anita Desai, and her third book, about childhood, love, life and high society in Karachi during the turbulent 1990s is worth all the prepublication fuss." - Harper's Bazaar<br><br>Kamila Shamsie, author of two previous novels, has been twice shortlisted for the John Llewelyn Rhys/Mail on Sunday Prize and named by the Orange Prize Futures as one of "21 writers for the 21st century.&#x201d; She lives in London and Karachi, and serves as Visiting Professor of English at Hamilton College.<br></p><h2>Navy SEAL Noel (Men of Valor, 3)</h2><p>A LETHAL REUNION&nbsp;<br><br>Abducted by a drug cartel, scientist Jessalynn McCoy's orders are simple&#x2014;produce a deadly toxin, or be killed.

They'd had too much to drink, but weren't worth a second look. A girl who didn't look old enough to even be in the bar leaned against the jukebox and flirted with the gray-haired man beside her. She looked up and caught Will's eye. Hers brightened, a slow smile forming on too-red lips.<br><br>Will looked away fast.<br><br>The last thing he needed was a girl latching onto him in front of his new XO.<br><br>He slipped between two tables, pushing toward the back of the room, finishing his survey. The place wasn't particularly crowded, given the weekday night, but the green and blue neon lights made faces almost unrecognizable.<br><br>What if he couldn't identify the captain? He hadn't seen him in more than ten years, and McCoy had been none too happy on that occasion. In fact, the last time they'd met, McCoy had been downright red in the face to see his little girl sneaking into the house at zero dark hundred. Will hadn't exactly meant to drop Jess off so late, but he'd been a reckless kid, cocky and assured. And when the old navy man had clamped a hand on his shoulder and stared hard at him, Will had nearly buckled. Would he be able to recognize McCoy without the searing anger and disapproval in the older man's expression&#x2014;or would both still be there, even after all these years?<br><br>When he reached the last booth in the farthest corner, all concern about recognizing Jess's dad vanished in an instant. Captain McCoy hadn't aged much. Still broad, with an angular jaw, and barely a wrinkle around his narrow eyes. He kept his black hair in a traditional military cut, and in the light any hint of gray was indistinguishable. But there <i>was</i> something different about him. McCoy, who had always stood so proudly, slumped in the vinyl booth, head bowed over a half-empty glass. He seemed intent on examining the surface of the table, but his mind was clearly engaged elsewhere.<br><br>Will walked over and waited for the other man to acknowledge him. When McCoy glanced up, his eyes turned into slits, a frown firmly in place. "I don't need anything."<br><br>Maybe Will was the one who had changed.<br><br>Ten years, thirty pounds and a SEAL Trident pin would do that to a man.<br><br>Or maybe it was just the haze hanging over the room.<br><br>"Captain McCoy?" Will kept his words short, in case he reverted back to that eighteen-year-old kid whose voice had had a habit of cracking under pressure.<br><br>McCoy squinted harder before jumping out of the booth to assess him more closely. After a long pause, he said, "William?"<br><br>"Yes, sir." He held out his hand, expecting a shake, but McCoy clapped him on the back, nearly hugging him.<br><br>"It's good to see you, son. I almost didn't recognize you out of uniform." Not the reaction Will had been expecting, but it was a far cry better than the alternative. McCoy motioned to the table and slid back into the booth. Will sat down opposite him. "How are your parents? Still living in the area?"<br><br>"They're fine, sir. Dad just retired, and they moved closer to the beach so he can surf more."<br><br>The captain chuckled silently, his shoulders bobbing and a few wrinkles forming on either side of his mouth. But the humor never reached his eyes, which were pained. He wrapped his hands around his glass of soda and gazed into the dark brown liquid.<br><br>Will opened his mouth to ask about Jess, but snapped it closed before the words could pop out. He had no right to ask how she was doing or what she'd done in the past decade. Not even if she'd ever gotten married, settled down, had a family.<br><br>The pain wasn't as acute as it had been at first, but the idea of his childhood best friend married to someone else still hit him like a punch in the stomach. At least he knew she hadn't married his brother, Salvador. That's why they'd stopped talking&#x2014;because Jess had said she was thinking about accepting Sal's promise ring. And because Will had decided that ignoring her phone calls was the best way to deal with the pain those words had caused.<br><br>Well, that and because he'd done the only thing he could think of to get away from having to watch Jess marry his older brother. He'd joined the navy, shipped out for parts unknown and made no effort to keep in touch. He only knew that she hadn't married Sal&#x2014;hadn't even accepted his ring and had broken Sal's heart in the process. His mom had told him that much.<br><br>Will didn't have any right to ask how Jess was doing, so he canned the small talk and asked the important question.<br><br>"You wanted to meet me, sir. What can I do for you?"<br><br>McCoy released a breath that deflated his shoulders, the dim light in his eyes vanishing altogether. He glanced toward the front door before clearing his throat. "I need your help."<br><br>"Yes, sir." Will bit his tongue to keep from asking why the captain hadn't asked for this meeting to take place in his office on Coronado.<br><br>Turning his glass in endless circles, the older man stared hard at the bouncing ice cubes. The seconds ticked by as the ambient noise built around them, a group singing their hearts out by the jukebox leading the charge.<br><br>"I need this conversation to stay off the record."<br><br>Will leaned forward, his elbows spread and arms resting on the sticky tabletop. "All right."<br><br>"You're under no obligation to agree to what I'm about to ask you to do." Will nodded, but McCoy continued as though he hadn't noticed. "If this goes badly, it could cost me my commission and you your place on the teams."<br><br>Will swallowed a lump that had lodged somewhere below his Adam's apple. This was his chance to walk away. McCoy was giving him an out before he knew too much. If he stuck around, he'd be privy to information that was bound to get them both in trouble.<br><br>But he hadn't been summoned by chance. None of the other men on his boat crew had been invited. McCoy had called him specifically.<br><br>If the tingling of his spine was any indication, it had everything to do with their past acquaintance.<br><br>"Something happened to Jess." It wasn't a question, and as the words tumbled out of Will's mouth, his stomach rolled. His Jess. His best friend from junior high to graduation. If she needed him, she was in trouble, and the situation was worse than he could imagine. Batting down the accompanying nausea, he squinted across the table. "Tell me everything."<br><br>Jabbing his fingers through his hair, McCoy let out a slow breath. "Jessalynn is working on her PhD in bioengineering and had a grant to study an airborne pathogen at Southern California State University."<br><br>Will let out a low whistle, the sound involuntary and ill equipped to convey how impressive he found her achievements.<br><br>"Three days ago she was working late in the lab. The security alarm went off about oh one hundred, and when the guard arrived, the lab had been ransacked. Jess and her bioweapon had vanished."<br><br>Fire shot through Will's forehead and he covered his face with his hands, praying this was some sort of sick joke. But the XO sat in equally stunned silence, as if this was the first time he'd spoken the truth aloud.<br><br>Massaging his temples, Will growled low in the back of his throat. "Who took her?"<br><br>"The DEA thinks that it's a Panamanian drug cartel."<br><br>"And they want what?"<br><br>McCoy's face crumpled in silent agony. Just seeing it made Will's chest hurt, and he clawed at his T-shirt, searching for air, the smell of alcohol and perfume catching in his throat. He could picture Jess's bright grin and the mischievous twinkle in her eyes. But he could not picture her in Panama, fear etching her facial features until they were unrecognizable.<br><br>This was a hoax. Someone was playing a cruel joke.<br><br>His Jess couldn't be at the hands of some drug cartel. She was safe and sound. And probably long-ago married to someone who actually deserved her.<br><br>Except the tortured voice of a father unable to save his only child wasn't easily conjured. It carried with it the pain of broken hearts and lost dreams.<br><br>Sean McCoy wasn't tricking him. He was a man in need of help.<br><br>Will closed his eyes, pursed his lips until they almost touched the tip of his nose and released a pent-up breath. "Let me guess. They want to use the pathogen and need someone to release it for them."<br><br>"A friend at the DEA says there's a bitter land war going on down there between two cartels. Bringing in a biological weapon seems very in character. Unfortunately, since they're only attacking each other rather than targeting civilians, the DEA isn't interested in getting involved, as long as it's not crossing over our borders."<br><br>"Doesn't kidnapping an American count as crossing our borders?"<br><br>He shook his head. "They can't definitively prove who was behind the abduction. And they're about as eager to poke around drug cartels as a mouse would be to wake a snoring bobcat."<br><br>"What about the government? Why don't they send a team down to extract her?"<br><br>McCoy closed his eyes. "There's not enough intel to know exactly where she's been taken. They're searching all of Panama right now, but the jungle is dense, and it could be weeks before they have enough info to send in an extraction team."<br><br>The captain's unspoken words hung between them. Jess didn't have weeks to spare.<br><br>With folded hands pressed to his wrinkled forehead, Will pinched his eyes closed. Someone had to go after Jess. She wouldn't survive for long after the cartel got what they wanted. Once she'd served her purpose, they would have no need for her.<br><br>His middle clenched, as if he was preparing for a blow from an opponent in the boxing ring. The truth hit harder than any fist.<br><br>The cartel would dispose of her. Soon.<br><br>He'd always thought he'd have a chance to end their decade of silence. And a bunch of drug-slinging bioter-rorists weren't going to take that chance from him. He owed her an apology, and he would make sure he had a chance to deliver it.<br><br>Pressing flat hands to the tabletop, he gazed into McCoy's haunted eyes across the table. "What is it you want me to do?"<br><br>Another sigh. Another droop to the wide shoulders. "The United States Navy has no official jurisdiction in this situation. Officially, they have no information about it and absolutely no plans for a rescue attempt."<br><br>"I understand."<br><br>"Do you?" Bushy eyebrows pulled together, and a flicker of something akin to hope appeared in the captain's hazel eyes, so much like his daughter's.<br><br>"Yes, sir. I'm going to need approval for a short leave of absence."<br><br>For the first time that evening, the corner of McCoy's mouth quirked upward in a true smile. "Done."<br><br>"I'll be out of touch. Completely." He stared hard at the older man, wishing he could come right out and tell the tough truth. But now that Will had agreed, McCoy needed to set up some plausible deniability. The captain couldn't know the details. If a superior officer started asking questions, he'd have to tell the truth. No details meant no lies.<br><br>The XO hadn't asked Will to do anything. No orders. Not even a suggestion. Just a conversation in a seedy bar far from the base and further from their norm. No one would recognize them enough to pinpoint that this was the night their lives changed.<br><br>But they were about to.<br><br>"I understand," McCoy said.<br><br>Eager tension built in his legs, and Will nodded toward the door. "I'd better get going." He slid across the bench and zipped his jacket as he rose.<br><br>The captain followed his movements, trailing him between the pool tables and into the starlit parking lot. Gusts of fresh air were like a lifeboat to a man who didn't know he was drowning. The sweet scent of the breeze wrapped around him, and he took deep breaths through his nose until his mind was clear of everything but the mission ahead of him.<br><br>"Thank you." The older man's voice was lower, more gravelly.<br><br>Will nodded, but didn't directly respond. Instead he said, "Please let her husband know that I'll do everything I can."<br><br>McCoy shoved his hands into the pockets of his blue jeans and cocked his head to the side, his ear almost to his shoulder. "Her husband?"<br><br>His palms suddenly sweaty, Will rubbed them against his pants. Was McCoy just pulling his leg or was it possible that she'd never settled down? Jess marrying someone&#x2014;anyone&#x2014;else had been the reason for ten years of silence. Was it possible she'd never gotten married at all?<br><br>The questions running through his mind must have been broadcast on his face because the captain let out a low chuckle. "Oh, Jess quit dating about the time you disappeared."<br><br>Will nodded, confusion mixing with an unnamed emotion in his chest and leaving him speechless.<br><br>"She said she'd rather focus on her education. I tried to talk to her about it, but she didn't have much to say on the matter. I wish like fire that her mother had been around for that. She'd have known what to say. Instead I bumbled through, and Jessalynn told me not to worry about it, so I let it go."<br><br>The words tumbled around Will's mind as he tried to make sense of them. Finally, they reemerged as a question as smooth as sandpaper. "Then Jess is&#x2014;she's not&#x2014;she's never gotten married?"<br><br>"No. She's not married." The captain offered a fraction of a grin. Maybe it was just a twitch, but it sure looked like more. Like an invitation to be a man instead of running like the boy he'd been all those years before.<br><br>McCoy clapped him on the back before striding toward his car. Halfway there, he spun around with a loose shrug of one shoulder. "Try not to start a war, son."<br><br>"Yes, sir. I'll try."<br><br>But no promises. If it took a war to save Jess, he'd start and end it.</p><h2>Games Wizards Play (Young Wizards Series, 10)</h2><p>Every eleven years, Earth's senior wizards hold the Invitational: an intensive three-week event where the planet's newest, sharpest young wizards show off their best and hottest spells.

Penn's egotistical attitude toward his mentors complicates matters as the pair tries to negotiate their burgeoning romance. Meanwhile, Dairine struggles to stabilize her hero-worshipping, insecure prot�g�e against the interference of powerful relatives using her to further their own tangled agendas. When both candidates make it through to the finals stage on the dark side of the Moon, they and their mentors are flung into a final conflict that could change the solar system for the better . . . or damage Earth beyond even wizardly repair.</p><p><b>DIANE DUANE</b> is the author of nearly fifty science fiction and fantasy novels, including&nbsp;ten books in&nbsp;the Young Wizards series<i>.</i> Four of her <i>Star Trek</i> novels have been <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>Spock's World</i>.&nbsp;She lives with her husband in rural Ireland.

Credited with saving countless lives, the Marine scouting missions went in stealthily at night from submarines, PT boats, Catalinas, and high-speed transports. Swift, silent, and deadly, they landed on more than two hundred enemy beaches from Guadalcanal to Tarawa, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, collecting intelligence on potential landing sites. They measured water depths, charted coral heads, gathered soil samples, sought out enemy locations, and took photographs. In short, they obtained information vital to the success of American operations in the Pacific.<br>With this book World War II Marine recon landings are chronicled for the first time - only in later wars have their contributions been fully documented. Here Meyers explains the start of it all, letting readers appreciate the courage and daring of these intrepid Marines as they slipped over the sides of their rubber boats and made their way inland.</p><p>Bruce F.

From the colonial period to contemporary cartoonists like Pat Oliphant and Jimmy Margulies, Donald Dewey highlights these artists uncanny ability to encapsulate the essence of a situation and to steer the public mood with a single drawing and caption. Taking advantage of unlimited access to The Granger Collection, which holds thousands of the most significant works of Thomas Nast and the other early American cartoonists, <b>The Art of Ill Will</b> provides a survey of American history writ large, capturing the voice of the people?hopeful, angry, patriotic, frustrated?in times of peace and war, prosperity and depression.<br>Dewey tracks the cartoonists role as a jester with a serious brief. Ulysses S. Grant credited cartoonists with helping him win his election and was not the only president to feel that way; political bosses and even state legislatures have sought to ban cartoons when they endangered entrenched interests; General George Patton once promised to throw beloved wartime cartoonist Bill Mauldin in jail if he continued to spread dissent. (Mauldin later won the Pulitzer Prize.)<br>Despite the increasing threats they face as daily newspapers merge or vanish, cartoonists have given us some of our most memorable images, from Theodore Roosevelt&#x2019;s pince-nez and mustache to Richard Nixon&#x2019;s Pinocchio nose to Jimmy Carters Chiclet teeth. At a time when domestic and foreign political developments have made these artists more necessary than ever, <b>The Art of Ill Will</b> is a rich collection of the wickedly clever images that puncture pomposity and personalize American history.<br> <b>Cartoonists include:</b> Benjamin Franklin (whose Join, or Die was the first modern American political cartoon), the astoundingly prolific Thomas Nast, Puck magazine founder Joseph Keppler, Adalbert Volck, suffragist Laura Foster, Uncle Sam creator James Montgomery Flagg, Theodore Geisel departing from his Dr. Seuss persona to tackle World War II, Herbert Herblock Block (who so enraged Richard Nixon that the president canceled his subscription to the Washington Post), Daniel Fitzpatrick, Jules Feiffer, Paul Conrad, Gary Trudeau, and the controversial Ted Rall.</p></p><p><b>Donald Dewey</b> is the author of twenty-five books and hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles published throughout the world. He wrote acclaimed biographies of actors James Stewart and Marcello Mastroianni, and has been awarded the Nelson Algren Prize for fiction. His history of baseball fans, <i>The Tenth Man: The Fan in Baseball History</i>, was cited by numerous publications as one of the best books of 2004. He lives in New York City.Dewey, a writer of fiction and nonfiction (<i>James Stewart</i>), explores the evolution of American political cartooning from its origins in the 18th century through its proliferation in the 19th and up to its current state, beleaguered by, among others, litigation and political correctness. Dewey's review of racist portraits of blacks and Jews is commonplace, but elsewhere he explores less familiar territory, such as attempts to censor political cartoons. After a lengthy introductory essay, Dewey presents five thematically organized chapters with more than 200 cartoons. The chapter on presidents includes Bill Mauldin's mournful response to JFK's assassination and Doug Marlette's portrayal of Jimmy Carter as the cowardly lion and Ronald Reagan as the tin man in the 1980 presidential election. The most surprising and clever cartoon in the Wars and Foreign Relations chapter is a 1902 skewering of American imperialism, showing Uncle Sam, dressed as Santa Claus, presenting a gift bag to a suspicious Filipino child. Dewey's chapter prefaces occasionally shed fascinating light; in the chapter on Ethnic, Racial, and Religious Issues, he observes that most 20th-century newspapers have shied away from cartoonists with skeptical views of mainline churches and their espoused Christian values. This will make a nice coffee-table title for political junkies. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was a man," laments Atalanta about her overbearing father. Atalanta, Andromeda, and Psyche--three Greek heroines bound by love, or by the harsh bonds of a patriarchal society? In these feminist retellings of classic love stories, Clemence McLaren, author of <i>Waiting for Odysseus</i> and <i>Inside the Walls of Troy</i>, tells it like it really was for women back in the Greek day--early marriage followed by complete sacrifice to a husband's sometimes selfish will. But these women refuse to accept that fate, and try instead to somehow get around their father-chosen futures. The story of Atalanta, the haughty girl athlete who refused to marry, is turned into a poignant tale of an obedient daughter doing her best to please her arrogant father, despite his unreasonable demand that she compete with her suitors--to the death. Andromeda is reluctantly resigned to marrying her father's old fogy friend, until fate intervenes in the form of a giant sea monster and a dashing young hero. But it's poor Psyche, so beautiful that people worship her instead of the goddess Aphrodite, who has to confront the most unpleasant creature of all--an angry mother-in-law who also happens to have the power of Mount Olympus at her fingertips. Three women, three marriages, three stories that riot grrrls of today will easily relate to, thanks to McLaren's savvy way of showing how real Greek women were far from being seen as goddesses, and just as unlikely to be treated as such. Divinely recommended. (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Jennifer Hubert</i><p> "These three love stories were my first retellings from Greek mythology, written when I was teaching on the island of Maui," Clemence McLaren says. "At the time, I was telling my Hawaiian students these myths from other islands half a world and three thousand years away, and they encouraged me to write them down. </p><p> "Now, fifteen years later, I find that the best thing about being a writer is getting letters from young readers, especially young women. They often find in my retellings the voices of those that were silenced in the ancient stories."</p></p><h2>The Democrats: A Critical History</h2><p><p>"Worthy reading for anyone who is interested in social change."--<i>MediaMouse.org</i></p><p> "The Democrats is at its best not just when analyzing Democratic foibles and there are plenty but when assessing how the party stifles dissent .

The Democrats: A Critical History systematically debunks the notion that the Democratic Party is a progressive force, and that it can be pushed to the left by its voting base.

McChesney, co-author, The Death and Life of American Journalism<br><br> The Democratic Party, Lance Selfa demonstrates, is the graveyard of American social movements, its grassy knolls entombing the disappointed carcasses of Populism, Progressivism, Labor, and the Green movement. The Democrats should be required reading for anyone seeking to understand why Barack Obama turned out to be the undertaker of reform.&#x201d;<br> Roger D. Hodge, author, The Mendacity of Hope<br><br> With a new, duly-deserved chapter on the Obama Era, Lance Selfa&#x2019;s The Democrats reveals the many ways in which the establishment Democratic Party has not just dashed progressive hopes over centuries but served as a distraction from the desperately needed business of making real change in this country. Writing dismal history like this is dirty work, but somebody&#x2019;s got to do it and Seifa&#x2019;s straight talk actually lifts ones spirits.&#x201d;<br> Laura Flanders, host of The Laura Flanders Show<br><br> At a time when our political discourse has reached its basest depths, and many are left scratching their heads as to why corporate America is stronger than ever while the rest of us reel in this recession, Lance Selfa&#x2019;s timely book helps us understand clearly why the Democratic Party is its own worst enemy.

Bossy provides a study of the internal history of the community, its geography, numbers, religious behavior, social structure, and ecclesiastical institutions. He rejects the common view that the community declined between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, and demonstrates that, on the contrary, it experienced a slow but steady development, culminating in a period of early nineteenth-century maturity and vigor. The English Catholic Community, 1570-1850 is, doubtless, the most comprehensive account of the internal history of any nonestablishment religious community in England during this period. Much more complete and methodical than previous studies, written from a largely sociological standpoint, the book presents the history of the Catholic community within the context of the whole of English history and within its religious groupings in particular. John Bossy provides the basis not only for a new understanding by Catholics themselves of their past, but provides for the just reassessment by historians of the community&#39;s particular role in English history.</p><p></p><h2>Quiche Cookbook</h2><p>Here are nearly 100 of the most unique and tasty quiche recipes ever compiled into one book.</p><p>rly 100 of the most unique and tasty quiche recipes ever compiled into one book.</p><h2>The New Erotic Photography</h2><p>The most provocative modern image makers Imagine walking into a room filled with the world&#39;s finest contemporary erotic photographers, each with a portfolio of his or her best work.

Acclaimed journalist and investor Bob Swarup tracks the history of speculative fevers caused by the appearance of new profitable investment opportunities; the new assets created and the increasing self-congratulatory euphoria that drives them to unsustainable highs, all fed by an illusion of insight and newly minted experts; the unexpected catalysts that eventually lead to panic; the inevitable crash as investors scramble to withdraw their funds from the original market and any other that might resemble it; and finally, the brevity of financial memory that allows us to repeat the cycle without ever critically evaluating the drivers of this endless cycle.<br>In short, it is the story of what makes us human.</p></p><p><p>Bob Swarup is a respected investor, thought leader and commentator on financial markets, investments and regulation. Born in India in 1977, he was educated in England. He holds an MA from the University of Cambridge, two Master degrees, and a Phd in cosmology from Imperial College London. He has managed investments at financial institutions, sat on the boards of hedge funds and private equity firms, worked closely with leading think tanks, advised policymakers and industry alike, and is an award-winning journalist. He lives in London.</p>[An] excellent new book, which looks at booms, panics and busts down the ages. ... [The] message is that nothing is really new. Put together people, credit and structural fragility and you create the perfect conditions for a crisis. ...Swarup's book comes out at an opportune moment. ...As [he] notes, humans don't like to stand still. <br>- Larry Elliott, <i>The Guardian</i><br><br>[Swarup] traces the same foibles of human nature that caused financial disaster in the Roman Empire to those that contributed to the most recent global economic woes. ...[His] analysis of the human elements make his work compelling and comprehensible, as he expertly surfs the crests and troughs of the economy and examines the behavior that contributes to the bumpy ride. ...If Swarup's analysis didn't hit so close to home, this title would be a cozier read...well worth reading for its engaging and long-reaching investigation of what fuels money mania and why it matters. - <i>Library Journal</i><br><br>Swarup discusses the recent financial debacle of 2008, noting that "as defaults soared ...the finger-pointing began." The biggest surprise is why this crisis was a surprise at all, given recent credit crunches, and he reaches back through the centuries to report that banking bailouts even occurred in ancient Greece and Rome. ... [His] final commentary includes "No One Is Too Big to Fail," "We Need to Restore Failure as an Option at All Levels," and "We Need to Create the Right Incentives."

Their Christian faith was their lens and foundation for everything&#x2014;their marriage, their music, their dreams for the future. But as their dreams began to come true, she began to wonder if her religion was really representative of the &#x2018;good news&#x2019; she had been taught.</p><p>She never expected the questions to lead as far as they did when her husband told her he no longer believed in God. The death of a friend, the unraveling of relationships and career, the loss of a worldview, and the birth of a baby girl with two heart defects all led Lisa to a tumultuous place; one of depression and despair. And it was there that her perspective on everything changed. <em>The Most Beautiful Thing I&#x2019;ve Seen</em> tells the story of what can happen when you dare to let go of what you think to be true; to shift the kaleidoscope and see new colors and dimension by way of broken pieces.</p><p>Lisa&#x2019;s eloquent, soul-stirring memoir brings you to a music stage before thousands of fans and a front porch where two people whisper words that scare them to the core. It is the story of how doubt can spark the beginning of deeper faith; how a baby born with a broken heart can bring love and healing to the hearts of many, and ultimately, how the hardest experience in life often ends up saving us.</p></p><p><p>Lisa Gungor has been scribbling down songs since she was seven years old.

In a world that runs on clan alliances and gasolina (i.e., whatever keeps things running: car fuel, alcohol, bribe money, offers of sex, etc.), Hector Basbas has just won (or bought) the Presidency, but when the incumbent refuses to step down, it's clear that His Excellency (to be) will have to come up with more gasolina, US covert support, and strong-arm persuasion if he, with his twin sister Katerina, are to achieve their goal: transforming a so-called democracy into a monarchical dynasty. The twins' maneuvers--along with hints of their incestuous connection--are filtered mostly through the point-of-view of Teresa Tikloptuhod. Teresa, daughter of a Provincial Governor, saved herself from terminal boredom and became a Basbas confidante by providing assistance when Katerina was traveling the country on foot, apparently as part of a demented pilgrimage. Author Rosca, who was briefly imprisoned under martial law in 1972, pleasantly surprises by giving the tyrannical twins some sympathetic complexity: Katerina's shoe collection can be explained by childhood humiliations; Hector does penance for his evil acts of murderous treachery. Still, no character here emerges as real or even interesting; attempts at surreal humor and magic realism never lift off the ground. A low-energy outing, despite the atmosphere of excess. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Twice every three days another citizen is shot, stabbed, or bludgeoned to death. At the cente of this hurricane of crime is the city&#39;s homicide unit, a small brotherhood of men confronted by the darkest of American visions. David Simon was the first reporter ever to gain unlimited access to a homicide unit, and his remarkable book is both a compelling account of casework and an investigation into our culture of violence. The narrative follows Donald Worden, a veteran investigator nearing the end of his career; Harry Edgerton, an iconoclastic black detective in a mostly white unit; and Tom Pellegrini, an earnest rookie who takes on the year&#39;s most difficult case, the brutal rape and murder of an eleven-year-old girl.</p><p>This 1992 Edgar Award winner for best fact crime is nothing short of a classic. David Simon, a police reporter for the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, spent the year 1988 with three homicide squads, accompanying them through all the grim and grisly moments of their work--from first telephone call to final piece of paperwork. The picture that emerges through a masterful accumulation of details is that homicide detectives are a rare breed who seem to thrive on coffee, cigarettes, and persistence, through an endlessly exhausting parade of murder scenes. As the <i>Washington Post</i> writes, "We seem to have an insatiable appetite for police stories.... David Simon's entry is far and away the best, the most readable, the most reliable and relentless of them all.... An eye for the scenes of slaughter and pursuit and an ear for the cadences of cop talk, both business and banter, lend Simon's account the fascination that truth often has."Edgar and Anthony Award Winner<br>Selected by the Literary Guild<br>"Remarkable...A true crime classic."<br>ASSOCIATED PRESS<br>Enter the workday of real policemen.

Can they do what no team has done before?</p><p>If you don t already know, The Wild Soccer Bunch is a worldwide children&#39;s book phenomenon, having sold over 9 million books in 30 countries! Writer Joachim Masannek based the series on his own experiences as soccer coach to his young sons. Masannek&#39;s initial idea was to create a series of 13 books, each one narrated by a unique member of the team. This idea was inspired by his belief that soccer is the most inclusive of all team sports. In fact, Masannek said, &#34;in soccer, every member of the team, regardless of his/her athletic ability, has an opportunity to be directly involved in the game. Everyone gets to run around, kick the ball, and enjoy their time outdoors.&#34; Masannek could never have anticipated the huge success that followed the release of the debut book in the Wild Soccer Bunch series in Germany. Soon, this soccer dad s artistic endeavor had millions of fans around the world, not to mention the wild success of book sales, films, and even merchandise. In fact, Masannek has written and directed five Wild Soccer Bunch feature films, breaking box office records in the process. These days, Masannek tours extensively, personally reading the books to underprivileged children across the world. If your child goes to bed wearing soccer cleats so they won t miss one minute of field time in the morning, he or she will fall in love with the Wild Soccer Bunch. And even if he or she is not the world&#39;s biggest fan, the book&#39;s universal themes of teamwork, leadership, diversity, and self-acceptance will still make an impact, and maybe even get them out and kicking a ball around! The series is a great way to introduce boys and girls alike to soccer, or any team sport; above all, the series is a fun read that will broaden the horizons of all kids, ages 8-14. Joachim Masannek, Born in 1960, studied German and Philosophy in college. He also studied at the University of Film and Television; worked as a camera operator, set designer and screenwriter in Films and TV. His children&#39;s book series The Wild Soccer Bunch has been published in 28 countries. As the screenwriter and director of the five The Wild Soccer Bunch movies, Joachim has managed to bring about nine million viewers into the theatres. He was the coach of the real Wild Bunch soccer team, coaching his sons Marlon and Leon.'I&#x2019;m a huge fan of the Wild Soccer Bunch.

Within three years of its original publication, the book went through fifteen printings; in 1943 the second edition appeared and was followed by seven reprintings. In the early 1940s, the text was widely used as the primary resource in the training of navigators for service in World War II. After the war, when pleasure sailing and boating became an increasingly popular pastime, Primer of Navigation found a new audience of readers eager to ensure their families and friends of safe, pleasurable, bluewater adventures.<br>Herrold Headley has now prepared a completely revised and updated seventh edition reflecting the latest developments in the art and science of navigation including vital new information on precise positioning and communication by electronic means; both Loran C and advancements in high-frequency FM and single side band radio telephone communications systems are covered in detail.</p><p></p><h2>The Bhagavad-Gita</h2><p>The Bhagavad Gita, or &#39;Song of the Spirit&#39;, is the best known book of India&#39;s national epic The Mahabharata. Based on a dialogue between Bhagavan Krishna and Prince Arjuna on the eve of a great battle, it is held to be the essence of Hindu spirituality, sacred literature and yoga, as well as exploring the great universal themes of courage, honour, death, love, virtue and fulfilment. Of interest to the large number of contemporary spiritual seekers - of any faith and none - who want to read the world&#39;s most important sacred texts, and to learn from their wisdom. Also useful for scholars of Vedic literature and students.</p><p>On the list of the greatest spiritual books of all time, the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> resides permanently in the top echelon. This poem of patently Indian genius sprouted an immense tree of devotional, artistic, and philosophical elaboration in the subcontinent. The scene is a battlefield with the prince Arjuna pitted against his own family, but no sooner does the poem begin than the action reverts inward. Krishna, Arjuna's avatar and spiritual guide, points the way to the supreme wisdom and perfect freedom that lie within everyone's reach. Worship and be faithful, meditate and know reality--these make up the secret of life and lead eventually to the realization that the self is the root of the world. In this titular translation, Stephen Mitchell's rhythms are faultless, making music of this ancient "Song of the Blessed One." Savor his rendition, but nibble around the edges of his introduction. In a bizarre mixture of praise and condescension, Mitchell disregards two millennia of Indian commentary, seeking illumination on the text from Daoism and Zen, with the <i>Gita</i> coming up just shy of full spiritual merit. Perhaps we should take it from Gandhi, who used the Gita as a handbook for life, that it nourishes on many levels. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Stephen Mitchell is widely known for his ability to make ancient masterpieces thrillingly new, to step in where many have tried before and create versions that are definitive for our time. His celebrated version of the Tao Te Ching is the most popular edition in print, and his translations of Jesus, Rilke, Genesis, and Job have won the hearts of readers and critics alike. Stephen Mitchell now brings to the Bhagavad Gita his gift for breathing new life into sacred texts.<br> <br>The Bhagavad Gita is universally acknowledged as one of the world's literary and spiritual masterpieces. It is the core text of the Hindu tradition and has been treasured by American writers from Emerson and Thoreau to T. S. Eliot, who called it the greatest philosophical poem after the <i>Divine Comedy</i>. There have been more than two hundred English translations of the Gita, including many competent literal versions, but not one of them is a superlative literary text in its own right.<br><br>Now all that has changed. Stephen Mitchell's <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> sings with the clarity, the vigor, and the intensity of the original Sanskrit. It will, as William Arrowsmith said of Mitchell's translation of <i>The Sonnets to Orpheus</i>, "instantly make every other rendering obsolete."<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Shaolin: Temple of Zen</h2><p>For the first time in history, the notoriously guarded warrior monks of the 1500-year-old Shaolin Temple--a Chinese Buddhist sect dedicated to preserving a form of kung fu known as the "vehicle of Zen"--have allowed their secretive society to be documented. With the blessing of the main abbot, Justin Guariglia earned the trust and full collaboration of the Shaolin monks to create an astonishing, empathic record of the Shaolin art forms and the individuals who consider themselves the keepers of these traditions. Over the past eight years, Guariglia has deftly captured the changing context of this ancient sect as it encounters the increasingly hyper-modern world of contemporary China. This amazing work provides viewers with a rare opportunity to examine the energy and spirit of the Shaolins' unique Zen practice, which has until now primarily been seen via pop-cultural interpretation in such films as <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>. It features serial imagery of fighting poses; cinematic grid images and cool design.</p><p>In these images, Justin Guariglia has captured one of the last oases of pure, unaffected Chinese culture. This sumptuous book is a must for anyone whose imagination is captivated by the search for the edge of human boundaries in a distant land. Justin Guariglia's photographs reveal an extraordinary culture dedicated to the pursuit of discipline and excellence--where mind and body are stretched to the extreme. <br> <b>-Edward Burtynsky</b> <p>Justin Guariglia provides a first--a perceptive look at the real monks of Shaolin Temple, their most inner sanctums, their devotional practice, and their traditional disciplines. He captures portraits of these venerated, compassionate warriors, who have survived the Cultural Revolution and ravenous tourists of modern China, and who stand guard at the very birthplace of the martial arts and Zen. <br> <b> --Gene Ching, <i>Kung Fu Magazine</i> </b></p>"This work documents, for the first time in history, the notoriously guarded warrior monks of the 1,500-year-old Shaolin Temple. Guariglia earned the trust and full collaboration of the Shaolin monks, creating an empathetic record of the Shaolin art forms and the individuals who consider themselves the keepers of these traditions." --Photo District News<br><br>"Photos capture cloistered monks and kung fu tradition." -- Diane Haithman --The Los Angeles Times<br><br>"The book also included black-and-white shots taken at night, lit by just one dim light bulb. These shots are highly atmospheric but they also reflect genuine kung fu practice and the extent of Guariglia's achievement in getting access -- the monks traditionally did kung fu at night so that no one could see what they were doing." -- Diane Smyth -- The British Journal of Photography</p><h2>A Potter&#39;s Companion: Imagination, Originality, and Craft (Park Street Press S)</h2><p>&nbsp; <br>In a celebration of the functional and the handmade, potter Ronald Larsen has gathered an engaging collection of essays, stories, poems, and observations by a wide range of potters, writers, philosophers, and other artisans, exploring the history, aesthetics, and philosophy behind making pots--or anything else--by hand.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Includes, among others, the writings of: <br>&nbsp; Marguerite Wildenhain--A Potter's Philosophy <br>&nbsp; Octavio Paz--Use and Contemplation <br>&nbsp; Lafcadio Hearn--The Tale of the Porcelain-God <br>&nbsp; John Updike--From the Journal of a Leper <br>&nbsp; Jamake Highwater--Illusions of Originality <br>&nbsp; Wallace Stevens--Anecdote of the Jar <br>&nbsp; Bernard Leach--The Potter's Challenge</p><p>A former professor of mathematics at Yale University who holds a Ph.D. from Stanford University, Ronald Larsen established Crary Mills Pottery in New York State in 1978.

Yokoyama's novel is a Jenga tower, each plot point and peripheral character part of an intricate balance . . . What is perhaps most striking about <i>Six Four</i> is the number of stories it contains. It probes the cruelty, pettiness and endless face-saving and ass-covering that come with bureaucratic infighting, as well as the anguished obsession that plagues the bereaved. It's an exhaustive police procedural, but one with broken families and, in the relationship of Mikami and his wife, Minako, snapshots of a tender marriage . . .

The book sold more than a million copies and was adapted both for film and for TV. Part of its appeal was the way it illuminated the country's deep tradition of hierarchy and control. This is a story about frustration at work--wanting to do what's right vs. needing to do what's expected. Though it deploys common tropes of crime fiction and its lightly noir style, <i>Six Four</i>'s unusual focus on the PR side of police work sets it apart and gives it unexpected heat.

But Roy has vanished into thin air, and now Banks fears this could have been their final conversation. Meanwhile, DI Annie Cabbot is called to a murder scene on a quiet stretch of road just outside Eastvale. A young woman called Jennifer Clewes has been found dead in her car, and in the back pocket of her jeans, written on a slip of paper, police discover Banks&#x2019;s name and address.<br><br>Living in his brother&#x2019;s empty, luxurious South Kensington flat, Banks finds himself digging into the life of the brother he never really knew, or even liked. He begins to uncover some troubling surprises, leaving Annie to track down Jennifer Clewes&#x2019;s friends and colleagues alone. It seems that both trails are leading towards frightening conclusions. And when the cases begin to intersect, the consequences for Banks and Annie become terrifying . . . <br><br><i>Strange Affair</i> is Peter Robinson&#x2019;s fifteenth Inspector Banks novel, and it amply demonstrates why he&#x2019;s counted among the top crime fiction writers in the world.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Without a doubt, the family and friends of fictional sleuths are two of the most endangered species on the planet. Crime novelists seem to have no qualms about sacrificing the people nearest and dearest to their protagonists, if doing so will advance plot development or bestow emotional depth upon their series stars. Peter Robinson continues this ruthless tradition in <i>Strange Affair</i>, his tension-packed 15th novel featuring headstrong British Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks. Still on the mend after the blazing finale of 2004's <i>Playing with Fire</i>, temporarily sworn off whiskey but back to smoking, Banks is interrupted in the midst of brooding over his life and failed relationships by a message from his estranged younger brother, Roy, who says he needs the DCI's help in "a matter of life and death." Concerned, especially since Roy boasts a history of dubious business dealings, Banks leaves Yorkshire for his sibling's home in London, only to find that residence unlocked, Roy's computer missing, and his cell phone left behind. After learning that Roy was last seen stepping into a car with an unidentified man, and receiving on Roy's mobile what appears to be a photo of his only brother slumped over in a chair, the cop fears that a kidnapping has occurred.<p> Meanwhile, back in Eastvale, Banks's colleague and ex-lover, Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot, probes the shooting death of Jennifer Clewes, a 27-year-old family planning center administrator from London who's been found in her car, with the address of Banks's once-ruined (and recently broken into) cottage tucked into her jeans pocket. As Annie seeks to identify Clewes's attacker and determine whether this crime fits a pattern of roadway assaults, she's anxious also to discover what connection Banks may have to the case. But the DCI is frustratingly nowhere to be found.</p><p> Like 2003's <i>Close to Home</i>, <i>Strange Affair</i> adds some welcome bricks to Banks's back story, this time forcing him to reappraise a brother whom he had long resented and distrusted. Simultaneously, Robinson's latest police procedural delivers artfully contrived, intersecting story lines charged with rumors of international arms dealing, hints of misdeeds at a women's clinic, secondary players so shady they might be invisible after sundown, and insights into just how far Banks's career has distanced him from folks less steeped in the ugly side of mankind. An immensely satisfying mystery, filled with professional risks and personal regrets, this is truly an <i>Affair</i> to remember. --<i>J. Kingston Pierce</i></p><p>A&nbsp;bullet to the brain abruptly halted a terrified young woman&#x2019;s desperate flight. In her pocket is the name of a policeman whose own life was brutally invaded, mercilessly shaken, and very nearly erased&#x2014;a policeman who has since gone missing.</p><p>The dead woman in the car had been running from something&#x2014;but she didn&#x2019;t run far or fast enough. Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot would like to question the man the victim was apparently racing to meet: Annie&#x2019;s superior&#x2014;and former lover&#x2014;Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks. But Banks has vanished into the anonymous chaos of the city, drawn into a mad whirl of greed, inhumanity, and death, by a frantic phone call from the brother he no longer knows. Banks is unaware that the threads connecting a sinister kidnapping with a savage slaying are as thick as rope . . . and long enough for a haunted and broken rogue cop to hang himself.</p></p><h2>Hamtramck: Soul Of A City (MI) (Images of America)</h2><p>Since its founding in 1798, the city of Hamtramck, Michigan has evolved from a dusty farming community on the edge of Detroit into a nationally recognized town of culture and character. The Dodge Main factory, founded in 1910, drew thousands of immigrants to the city of Hamtramck, and a vibrant, multi-cultural community began to grow. Over the course of the next 90 years, the people of Hamtramck developed a landmark educational system, a strong devotion to church and family, a fiery political scene, and labor-organizing activities with national reverberations. In this book, author Greg Kowalski uses a unique collection of historical photographs to document Hamtramck&#39;s incredible growth throughout the years, and reveal the unmatched integrity, commitment, and independence of its people.</p><p>Greg Kowalski is Chairman of the Hamtramck Historical Commission and a lifelong Hamtramck resident.

Translated into English for the first time, this stunning discovery has been hailed as a worthy sequel to The Art of War. Packed with precise strategies and detailed tactics that can be adapted to any organization, this sophisticated manual builds upon Sun Tzu&#39;s phenomenally popular teachings and offers powerful insights into such principles as strategic manoeuvring, tactical formation, and adaptation. Renowned scholar Thomas Cleary brings the sometimes cryptic meanings of Sun Tzu II&#39;s ancient Chinese wisdom to life. Like his translation of The Art of War, Cleary&#39;s rendering of The Lost Art of War is an absorbing and practical work, whose military metaphors can be adapted to the complexities of business, government, diplomacy, relationships, and social action.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Chinese</p><h2>Bankside: London&#39;s Original District of Sin</h2><p>On the south bank of the Thames and demarcated by Blackfriars and Tower Bridges lies the district known as Bankside, the Borough and Southwark. Its origin was in a Roman settlement nestling around the southern end of London Bridge, until the eighteenth century the only bridge across the Thames in London. Being separated only by the Thames from the City of London and outside the City&#39;s jurisdiction, it developed as a place for bawdy and disreputable entertainment and leisure - including the Globe Theatre made famous by performing William Shakespeare&#39;s plays. It was an area also sought out for its &#39;stews&#39; which were some of London&#39;s most notorious brothels where every taste could be catered for. Borough High Street contained proportionately more inns and taverns than anywhere else in Britain - and some were immortalised by Chaucer and Dickens. The George alone survives to give some idea of what these ancient hostelries were like. From a time when London was a collection of discrete districts and villages, here is the long history of Bankside, the metropolis&#39;s disreputable and licentious yet vibrant, cosmopolitan underbelly.</p><p>David Brandon spent much of his working life in adult education in colleges and universities.

Not only does Joe travel back in time over 50 years, stay at the Robinson's apartment, and become a bat boy for the Dodgers, but he is also transformed from a Polish American into an African American, introducing some interesting perspectives on race in the mid-20th century. The book is accurate in its baseball statistics, the geography and lingo of Brooklyn, and, unfortunately, in some of the harsh racial terms applied to African Americans in the 1940s. Fans of America's favorite pastime will particularly appreciate the detail and descriptions of some great games, including the 1947 World Series.

In a series of remarkable developments in the 20th century and continuing into the 21st, elementary particle physicists, astronomers, and cosmologists have removed much of the mystery that surrounds our understanding of the physical universe. We now have mathematical models that are consistent with all observational data, including measurements of incredible precision, and we have a good understanding of why those models take the form they do. But the question arises: Where do the &#34;laws&#34; revealed by the mathematical models come from? Some conjecture that they represent a set of restraints on the behavior of matter that are built into the structure of the universe, either by God or some other ubiquitous governing principle. In this challenging, stimulating discussion of physics and its implications, the author disputes this notion. Instead, he argues that physical laws are simply restrictions on the ways physicists may draw the models they use to represent the behavior of matter if they wish to do so objectively. Since mathematical descriptions of data must be independent of any specific point of view, that is, they must possess &#34;point-of-view invariance&#34; (maximum objectivity), they naturally conform to certain fundamental laws that insure that objectivity, such as the great conservation principles of energy and momentum. The laws of physics, however, are not simply an arbitrary set of rules since the observed data beautifully demonstrate their accuracy.</p><p><b>Victor J. Stenger</b>&nbsp;(1935 - 2014) was an adjunct professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado and emeritus professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Hawaii. He was the author of the<i>&nbsp;New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller&nbsp;<i>God: The Failed Hypothesis, God and the Atom, God and the Folly of Faith</i>,<i>&nbsp;The Comprehensible Cosmos</i>, and many other books.Stenger (<i>Has Science Found God?</i>), emeritus professor of physics at the University of Hawaii, goes to great lengths to explain that, although he is not completely convinced that the laws of physics as we know them have objective reality, he doesn't subscribe to the postmodernist notion that there is no such thing as objective reality. Stenger explains that the power of currently accepted models of physics arises from what he calls "point-of-view invariance," i.e., they have the ability to make the same predictions regardless of where or when an observer is taking measurements. While this point is well made and important, Stenger's descriptions of the models of physics and his discussion of cosmology will be largely incomprehensible to the average reader. A third of the book consists of eight mathematical supplements designed for "anyone who has taken the major courses in a four-year curriculum of undergraduate physics, chemistry, engineering, or mathematics."

It has been universally employed by students and scholars wherever English is spoken or used as an academic language. There are many Hebrew language study tools, such as grammars, lexicons (dictionaries), vocabularies, commentaries devoted to the Hebrew text, and volumes on word studies. However, the accumulated riches of over two thousand years of studies in the Hebrew Old Testament have been inaccessible to the Bible student who has not studied Hebrew. But with the publication of this new edition, entitled The Englishman&#39;s Hebrew and Chaldee Concordance of the Old Testament, Numerically Coded to Strong&#39;s Exhaustive Concordance, a tool for mining those riches has been provided for the student of the English Bible. James Strong was the first to equip students of the English Bible who do not know the Hebrew alphabet to do Hebrew word studies. This he did by incorporating into his Strong&#39;s Exhaustive Concordance the simple device of a numerical apparatus. He developed a Dictionary of the Hebrew Bible (found in the back of his concordance), in which he assigned a code number to each Hebrew or Chaldee (Aramaic) word found in the Old Testament. In order that students of the English Bible might be able to determine which Hebrew or Chaldee word is rendered by a particular English word in the Authorized (King James) Version, he placed the appropriate code numbers beside the Scripture references under all the various English words listed in his concordance. All of these words are found in Hebrew alphabetical order with the appropriate Strong&#39;s code numbers in this edition of Englishman&#39;s Hebrew and Chaldee Concordance. This volume includes a Hebrew - to - English Index, an English - to - Hebrew Index, and an Appendix of Hebrew and Chaldee proper names.</p><p></p><h2>Samurai Deeper Kyo Volume 26</h2><p>Kyoshiro and Kyo--one a peaceful medicine seller, the other a merciless red-eyed samurai--are two spirits fighting for dominance of the same body as they travel with Yuya, a bounty hunter who helps them look for Kyo&#39;s true body.</p><p></p><h2>Rabbit, Run</h2><p>It&#39;s 1959 and Harry &#39;Rabbit&#39; Angstrom, one time high school sports superstar, is going nowhere. At twenty-six he is trapped in a second-rate existence - stuck with a fragile, alcoholic wife, a house full of overflowing ashtrays and discarded glasses, a young son and a futile job. With no way to fix things, he resolves to flee from his family and his home in Pennsylvania, beginning a thousand-mile journey that he hopes will free him from his mediocre life. Because, as he knows only too well, &#39;after you&#39;ve been first-rate at something, no matter what, it kind of takes the kick out of being second-rate&#39;.</p><p>I read Rabbit, Run when I was in high school (and it wasn't even a school assignment!). Twenty years later (at least!), three very vivid scenes from that book still pop into my head from time to time. The first is the used-car lot, where Rabbit Angstrom, the former basketball star, works for his father-in-law. The second scene is in a very red Chinese restaurant that had changed over from a French restaurant only the week before. Rabbit is there with his old coach and two women that are not their wives, and they drink daiquiris and whiskey sours. This restaurant could have been (and was) in my small town. The third scene is the most harrowing, and I've repeated it as a cautionary tale to young mothers for years, telling the story as if it had happened to someone I know. Janice, Rabbit's wife, who slugs alcohol throughout her pregnancy, is drunk and bathing her newborn baby when something terrible happens. I won't ruin it by telling you more. I read hundreds of books a year, both for my job and for pleasure, so the fact that parts of this book are so indelibly etched in my mind is a testament to the talent and genius of John Updike.<br>P.S. all of the other books in the Rabbit series are equally unforgettable.<br>--Maureen O'Neal"Brilliant and poignant...By his compassion, clarity of insight and crystal-bright prose, he makes Rabbit's sorrow his and our own."<p>THE WASHINGTON POST</p><p>Harry Angstrom was a star basketball player in high school and that was the best time of his life.

Greenberg, Lellenberg, and Stashower also edited the widely praised anthology <em>Murder in Baker Street</em>.Modern authors can't stop writing about Sherlock Holmes. This collection of 11 short stories brings together some of the best recent efforts. The authors represented, all established veterans of the genre, include such diverse talents as Anne Perry, Edward Hoch, Stuart Kaminsky, and Loren Estleman. Except for some slips into modern language, the stories are uniformly satisfying. In addition to a pace that would delight the energetic Holmes, the stories have clever plots and strong characters, including vivid portraits of historical figures such as Jane Austen, Bram Stoker, and Sir Richard Burton. The action hinges not only on the ancient sins of greed and lust but also on "new" technologies such as photography and motion pictures. This collection should be required reading for anyone planning to write about Holmes, his friends, and his foes. Unlike so many latter-day Holmes tales, done in by rambling dialogue and leaden masses of detail, the stories collected here remind readers of the elements of Conan Doyle's greatness: difficult puzzles, vivid but selective detail, and tight dialogue. <i>John Rowen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Shenandoah and the True Conclusion of the American Civil War</h2><p><p>In the autumn of 1864, at the height of the American Civil War, the Confederate raider <em>Shenandoah</em> received orders to "seek out and utterly destroy" the whaling fleets of New England as part of an effort to bleed the Union of its economic strength -- an undertaking that met its greatest success when the raider fell upon a fleet of whalers working the waters near Alaska's Little Diomede Island and sank more than two dozen ships in a frenzy of destruction.</p><p>Before the <em>Shenandoah</em>'s voyage was over, the raider had captured or sunk thirty-eight ships. She also took more than a thousand prisoners and led the best warships of the Union navy on a twenty-seven-thousand-mile chase that ended with her escape to England, making her the only Confederate vessel to circumnavigate the globe. At the end of her journey -- truly one of the most remarkable in naval history -- the effects of the raider's actions reached far beyond the glow of the flames marking the sky above the Arctic ice. The inferno signaled not only the near-demise of the New England whaling industry, but also the end of America's growing hegemony over worldwide shipping for the next eighty years. These Civil War clashes also helped precipitate the establishment of international laws that remain in effect today.</p><p>But more important than the tally of damage was the date the final conflagration began: June 22, the longest day of the year, and almost a full three months after General Lee lay down his sword at Appomattox. Contrary to contemporary belief, it was not on the battlefield in Virginia but high in the Arctic where the last shot of the American Civil War was fired.</p><p>Blending high-seas adventure and first-rate research, Lynn Schooler's <strong>The Last Shot</strong> is naval history of the very first order, offering a riveting account of the last Southern military force to lay down its arms.</p></p><p><p>Lynn Schooler, author of <em>The Blue Bear</em>, has lived in Alaska for more than thirty years. He is a two-time winner of <em>Alaska</em> magazine's grand prize for wildlife photography and winner of the National Wildlife grand prize.</p>A longtime Alaskan has given us this impressive history of the last Confederate commerce raider, which fired its last shot at a Yankee whaler north of the Aleutian Islands two and a half months after Appomattox. It begins with the ship leaving England under the name <i>Sea King</i>, then meeting a chartered cargo ship at Madeira and loading guns and other warlike gear&#x2014;without more than a fraction of the crew needed to use them. A gifted seaman if more than a little irascible, Capt. James Waddell recruited his crew as he sailed. After an eventful stop in Melbourne, Australia, the ship sailed north to the Arctic whaling grounds, ravaged the whaling fleet and was proceeding to attack the California gold ships when Waddell learned that the war was over&#x2014;whereupon he set off to deliver his ship and crew to the British by sailing 23,000 storm-tossed miles back to Liverpool without sighting land. Researched heavily from primary sources, filled with vivid personality portraits and almost miraculously accessible to readers without a background in maritime history, this is an absolutely irresistible sea story. The seafaring audience is likely to be as strong as or stronger than the Civil War audience for this book, and the combination may really set it afloat. <i>(June) </i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He lives in London. <br>Wine writer Clarke helps direct armchair connoisseurs to the right vineyards in this revised second edition of his beautifully illustrated guide to the world's great wines. Country by country and region by region, Clarke leads the reader through each location via panoramic maps so meticulously rendered by Keith and Sue Gage that they often convey the feeling of viewing the countryside from a low-flying plane. Beginning with a succinct explanation of how climate, weather conditions and soil affect the growth and taste of grapes, Clarke then moves into a geographical consideration of wines all over the globe, from Austria to Bulgaria to California. With each region-be it the Rhone Valley in France or the Brunello di Montalcino in Italy-Clarke covers history, geography, origins, appellations and classifications. Illustrations inform the reader about soil types and land patterns and show where specific vineyards lie. His margins are filled with samples of wine labels, bottles, various charts of details, keys to the maps and more, all combining to make this first-person account a handsome and truly informative resource. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dragons of Silk (Golden Mountain Chronicles)</h2><p><p>The Weaving Maid wove robes of silk for Heaven, but when she met the Cowboy, she abandoned her loom to be with him.

Visit her at RJ-Anderson.com.A Pocket Full of Murder Chapter One<p></p> <br>PROPPED ON THE FLOUR-DUSTED stand, the Book of Common Magic looked as innocent as the ordinary cookbooks tucked behind it. Only the tremor in Isaveth&#x2019;s fingers as she turned the pages betrayed her apprehension. She&#x2019;d never made spell-tablets all by herself before. Perhaps she should go to Aunt Sallume&#x2019;s and ask . . .<br> <br>But then she&#x2019;d have to pass the Kerchers&#x2019; house again, and Isaveth didn&#x2019;t like that idea at all. Not that their cottage was much worse than any of the others on Cabbage Street: There was nothing unusual about soot-stained brick, peeling paint, and a porch cluttered with old beer crates, even if the hole in the upstairs window did look like a fat spider sitting in its web. She&#x2019;d been bold enough earlier that morning, with Mimmi clinging to her hand and Lilet scowling at her heels; she&#x2019;d marched her sisters straight past the Kerchers&#x2019; and around the corner to Aunt Sal&#x2019;s without a second thought.<br> <br>Only, the porch had been empty then, and now it wasn&#x2019;t. Through the window she could see her schoolmate Loyal Kercher lounging on the front steps, with his elbows at the top and his legs stretched all the way to the bottom, smacking a mouthful of chew and waiting for his next victim to walk by. As soon as he spotted any girls or boys young enough to intimidate, he&#x2019;d jump out in front of them, all sneering mouth and leering eyes, and he wouldn&#x2019;t move until they told him their business and begged him to let them pass.<br> <br>The thought of submitting to such injustice made Isaveth hot all over. She&#x2019;d rather die than give Loyal the satisfaction, no matter how big he&#x2019;d grown this past year.<br> <br>Anyway, it wouldn&#x2019;t be right to trouble Aunt Sal with her dithering, especially when she already had Lilet and Mimmi and her own two little ones to look after. Isaveth was almost thirteen now, not a child anymore. It was time she learned to make magic on her own.<br> <br>Lighting the stove didn&#x2019;t worry her; she&#x2019;d done that plenty of times when her sister Annagail was late coming home from the shirt factory. And though Isaveth might singe her fingers if she got careless, making spell-tablets wasn&#x2019;t really dangerous. Her biggest fear was wasting binding powder and their even more precious store of magewort, neither of which would be easy to replace with her mother gone. Worse still, what if the magic didn&#x2019;t take? Isaveth would have burned good coal, and turned an already too-warm house into a furnace, for nothing.<br> <br>Yet if she didn&#x2019;t try it, nobody would, and the ingredients would go to waste anyway. Lilet and Mimmi were too young to make spells, let alone sell them. And though by rights the book belonged to Annagail, her older sister never touched it; she had no gift for spell-baking, and she&#x2019;d been hesitant to do it even when Mama was alive to help.<br> <br>But if Isaveth turned out to have even half her mother&#x2019;s talent, she&#x2019;d be able to peddle those little squares of heat and light for five citizens each. A hundred cits to a merchant, five merches to a noble, two nobs to a regal, ten regs to an imperial . . . not that Isaveth had ever seen that much money, but she&#x2019;d often dreamed about it. Even fifty cits&#x2014;a mere ten tablets&#x2019; worth&#x2014;would be enough to buy a big loaf of crusty bread and a fresh egg for everyone in the family. How wonderful that would be! It had been so long since Papa had steady work, they&#x2019;d been living mostly on beans and potatoes and the few scraggly onions they could coax out of their garden. Even the cheapest meat was a luxury, and Isaveth could scarcely remember the last time she&#x2019;d eaten a whole egg all by herself.<br> <br>Mustering her courage, Isaveth prepared the baking pans, greasing them well with falsebutter so the tablets wouldn&#x2019;t stick. The recipe in the Book of Common Magic looked simple, but all around it were notations in a familiar, delicate hand: Double magewort and halve binding powder in cold weather. Sift flour for neevils before mixing. Wash hands thoroughly!!!<br> <br>A familiar ache rose in Isaveth&#x2019;s throat. It had been half a year since Devra Breck died, but her presence still lingered in this kitchen, as though she had only stepped out and would be back at any moment. Softly Isaveth repeated the notes to herself, listening to the echo of her mother&#x2019;s voice in her memory. Then she dragged the big stoneware bowl out of the bottom cupboard and started assembling the ingredients.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>An hour later Isaveth had flour all over her apron, a sifter full of wriggling neevils, and hair limp with sweat. But the tablets had come out from the first baking golden and firm to the touch, just as they ought to be. She sprinkled them with binding powder and cut them into squares with the silver knife&#x2014;a sacred heirloom, and the only valuable thing her family still possessed. Once that was done, she slid one pan back into the oven and hurried to set the other in the brightest shaft of sunlight she could find. In a few minutes she&#x2019;d know if her magic had worked.<br> <br>It was hard to believe that even such simple spells had once been beyond the reach of ordinary folk like herself, the crystals and precious metals required too expensive for any but nobles and the wealthiest merchants to afford. The ways of magic were sacred, the early Sages claimed, and too sophisticated for uneducated people to understand.<br> <br>Yet there&#x2019;d been a few poor folk who defied the ban, working out cheaper ingredients through trial and error and passing on recipes by word of mouth. Little by little the craft had grown and spread&#x2014;especially among Isaveth&#x2019;s Moshite ancestors, who had excelled at finding herbs and minerals with magical properties&#x2014;until the nobles could no longer suppress it.<br> <br>So they&#x2019;d called it Common Magic, to distinguish it from their own more elegant and refined Sagery. And though at first most nobles deemed the use of such magic beneath them, they soon came to appreciate the economy and practicality of those spells, and adapted them for their own use as well. Now half of Tarreton ran on spell-power, and there were whole factories dedicated to turning out tablets much like the ones Isaveth was making. Stored heat, stored power, stored light . . .<br> <br>Was it her imagination, or did the kitchen feel cooler? Cautiously Isaveth approached the oven. A glance through the peephole assured her the burner hadn&#x2019;t gone out, but when she held her hand close to the door, she felt no warmth. The tablets were soaking up all the heat. Her magic was working! Isaveth clapped her hands together with delight and dashed to the front of the house to see how her other pan was doing.<br> <br>It was harder to judge this batch, since no spell could possibly capture all the light streaming through the window. The only sure test would be to take one into a darkened room and crumble it or drop it in a glass of water. Yet the flecks of magewort that dotted the tablets were glowing, and that was a good sign.<br> <br>Isaveth let the pans sit a little longer, to be sure they&#x2019;d soaked up all the light and heat they could hold. Then she dusted both batches with more binding powder, said a blessing over them&#x2014;that wasn&#x2019;t in the recipe, but it couldn&#x2019;t hurt&#x2014;and set them on racks to cool.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d done it! She&#x2019;d made real magic all by herself. After all the filthy, miserable hours she&#x2019;d spent collecting rags and scrap metal to help her family, Isaveth could only regret she hadn&#x2019;t worked up the nerve to try spell-baking sooner.<br> <br>The town clock tolled the hour, and Isaveth looked up in surprise. Could it really be three bells already? Wiping her hands, she closed the Book of Common Magic and put it away. Then she crossed to the open window and leaned out across the sill. A pack of scrawny boys half her age were running about the street, calling to one another in shrill voices&#x2014;&#x201c;Gimme the ball, it&#x2019;s my turn!&#x201d; &#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s no fair!&#x201d;&#x2014;but Isaveth ignored them. If she concentrated hard enough, she might be able to hear . . .<br> <br>The distant whistle of a peddler, his cart full of clinking bottles. The flap-snap of Missus Caverly&#x2019;s sheets drying on the line. But though Isaveth felt sure that someone in the neighborhood must be listening, she heard none of the music she yearned for&#x2014;the triumphant opening theme of Auradia Champion, Lady Justice of Listerbroke.<br> <br>It came on every Duesday afternoon, the most exciting talkie-play Isaveth had ever heard. It even got repeated on Fastday evenings for those who might have missed it. But Papa had sold their crystal set six months ago to help pay for her mother&#x2019;s memorial, so Isaveth had been reduced to eavesdropping on her neighbors ever since. Sometimes she was lucky enough to overhear part of the story. But not today.<br> <br>With a sigh Isaveth stepped back and let the curtain fall. It would be unfair to blame her father for selling the set, and there were a lot worse things to miss. But according to Morra Caverly, who&#x2019;d heard last week&#x2019;s episode while she was working, Auradia had been captured by a handsome thief lord who tried to charm her into pardoning his men, and when she refused, he put a knife to her throat. Of course Auradia would thwart him and escape, but Isaveth was itching to know how.<br> <br>There was no help for it, then. She&#x2019;d just have to write her own version of the story. Isaveth ran to fetch the box that held her stub of lead-point and the few scraps of paper she&#x2019;d been hoarding. Then she settled herself on the back step and began scribbling as fast as her thoughts could go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Release the men you captured, or die,&#x201d; hissed the thief lord, pointing his dagger menacingly at Auradia. &#x201c;That is my final offer.&#x201d;<br> <br>Even tied hand and foot to a chair with a gang of ruffians closing in upon her, Auradia Champion did not falter. &#x201c;Never,&#x201d; the noblewoman retorted with a proud lift of her chin. &#x201c;Kill me if you must, but I shall not release your men. My Lawkeepers will keep them in custody until a new Lord or Lady Justice is appointed, and then they will hunt you down and punish you as your wickedness deserves. You cannot escape! Surrender now, before it is too late!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you writing there, Vettie?&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked up, blinking, as the sights and sounds of Auradia&#x2019;s world faded away. Morra Caverly stood by the fence, a laundry basket balanced against her hip and her blond head tilted quizzically.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, nothing much,&#x201d; said Isaveth, coloring. Part of her would have liked to show the neighbor girl her story and ask what she thought, but Morra was letter-blind: She could read printed words only with great difficulty and had never learned to write. &#x201c;Just one of my Auradia stories.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Another one? What an imagination you&#x2019;ve got!&#x201d; Morra set down her basket and stretched to unpin a bedsheet from the line. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s all this for, then? Are you hoping the folk that make the talkie-play will hire you if you&#x2019;re good enough?&#x201d;<br> <br>That would be wonderful, but Isaveth hadn&#x2019;t thought that far ahead. She was too young to look for proper work yet, and she still had her schooling to finish. &#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; she said, absently twirling the lead-point between her fingers. &#x201c;I want to be a writer of some sort, but I&#x2019;m not sure what kind. Only . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Morra dropped the folded sheet into the basket. &#x201c;Only what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever it is, I want to be really good at it. Good enough to make lots of money.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And be famous, too, I suppose? So you can float off to Uropia and get a ladyship from the regent?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; asked Isaveth, taken aback by the other girl&#x2019;s sour tone. Usually Morra was cheerful and good natured, but now she sounded bitter. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be the first to do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;d be the first from this place, that&#x2019;s certain.&#x201d; Morra waved a hand at their surroundings: a line of pinched-looking cottages that ranged from run-down to ramshackle, with narrow strips of backyard divided by fences and the coal-lane running behind them. Even the midday sunlight couldn&#x2019;t banish the smog from the nearby factories, nor could the shouts of the neighbor children drown out their relentless din. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t blame you for wanting to get out of Cabbage Street. But to do so well by yourself that people forget where you came from? That&#x2019;d take a miracle of the Sages.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isaveth liked Morra, but she didn&#x2019;t like it when she talked like this&#x2014;as though being fifteen and cleaning house for a few merchants&#x2019; wives made her more mature than Isaveth would ever be. If growing up meant abandoning her dreams, Isaveth wanted no part of it. &#x201c;But if I did become a noble, I could help people and make the world a better place. Like Auradia did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but she was born noble, and she wasn&#x2019;t a . . .&#x201d; Morra stopped, made a face, and started over. &#x201c;Anyway, Auradia lived in another city a hundred years ago. I don&#x2019;t see our nobles helping anyone but themselves.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s Eryx Lording,&#x201d; Isaveth pointed out, though it was hard not to be distracted by the words Morra had left unsaid: wasn&#x2019;t a Moshite, like you. &#x201c;Everyone says he&#x2019;s the opposite of his father, and that&#x2019;s bound to be a good thing, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It would be if he was ruling Tarreton right now. But we&#x2019;re stuck with Sagelord Arvis, and Seward says he&#x2019;ll surely ruin this city before his son ever gets the chance to fix it. He&#x2019;s such a misery-miser that other cities scarce want to trade with us anymore, and there&#x2019;s so little work at the box factory, Da might be let go any day . . .&#x201d; Morra&#x2019;s voice cracked, and she gave a sniff. &#x201c;Well, never mind that. You&#x2019;ve got your own troubles. But you can see why I don&#x2019;t think much of nobles at the moment. Though I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;d make a fine one.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now Isaveth understood. Morra&#x2019;s older brother, Seward, had a passion for politics and no shortage of strong opinions about how the city was being run, and if he&#x2019;d been filling Morra&#x2019;s head with gloomy talk, it was no wonder she was anxious. Yet the Sagelord&#x2019;s greed and callousness had done so much damage to Tarreton&#x2019;s fortunes already, Isaveth found it hard to imagine how things could get much worse.<br> <br>She thought of her father, trudging the streets with his wheely-cart in search of work. A year ago Urias Breck had been a stonemason, skilled at his craft and respected for it. He&#x2019;d raised walls, laid drive paths, and built garden follies for the nobles and wealthy Sages who ruled the city. But the project he&#x2019;d staked all his hopes on had been canceled without warning, and there&#x2019;d been no more offers since. So now Papa had to make do with whatever small jobs he could find.<br> <br>Then there was Annagail, bowed over a sewing treadle in the dusty heat of the shirt factory. Until their mother died, she&#x2019;d been working hard to finish school so she could train as a healer. But the cost of the memorial had eaten up all their savings, and when it became clear that Papa could no longer earn enough to support them, she&#x2019;d left Isaveth in charge of the younger girls and taken the first job she could get. It was hard work in the factory, with long hours and little pay, and she would have been happier as a nursemaid or even a scrubber. But most wealthy folk were Arcan and preferred not to keep a Moshite girl about the house if they could hire a Unifying one instead. So sewing shirts was the best Annagail could do.<br> <br>Which was why Isaveth wanted so badly to succeed at something, whether that meant becoming a famous writer or merely a good spell-baker. She knew too well the uncertainty and hardship that Morra only feared, the hollow ache of hunger and the bone-gnawing chill of snowy nights without fu...</p><h2>Edna St. Vincent Millay (Poetry for Young People)</h2><p><p>"Well-written, engaging introduction...illuminates Millay's personal history and writing... luminous, evocative watercolors...A noteworthy addition to the poetry shelf... both informs and intrigues."&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Luminous, elegant illustrations bring these complex and insightful verses to life...all are fresh and alive and will draw readers into the book."&#x2014;<i>School Library Journal</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;"A good assortment of Millay's poetry."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The watercolor artwork creates atmospheric settings for her words."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Academic editor Frances Schoonmaker is a professor in the Department of Curriculum and Teaching at Teacher&#39;s College, Columbia University.

Illustrator Mike Bryce has a BA in fine arts and an MA in fine arts. He has taught art at many colleges and has illustrated for Houghton-Mifflin and Hallmark Cards. He lives in Rhode Island.As a bare introduction to Millay's poetry, this entry in the Poetry for Young People series is adequate, but should not be a substitute for other biographies or analyses of her work. Schoonmaker (Carl Sandburg, 1995) has written a four-page introduction to Millay's life before arranging a selection of more than 30 poems. In the narrative of Millay's childhood she includes many good details of her life at home (with a long explanation of her name, Vincent), but is silent on the topic of Millay's ``bohemian'' adult life, and more importantly, how the unconventional views of her poetry gave voice to the young generation of the roaring 20s. She reports that Millay's wealthy husband was a feminist, but not that Millay was, and offers no explanation of how her poetry reflected her strong convictions. In fact, although the book includes a good assortment of Millay's poetry, the format allows for almost no interpretation, particularly of the more ``adult'' poems that are include, e.g., ``First Fig,'' and ``Second Fig.'' Even if Schoonmaker chose not to venture into the charged territory of Millay's sexuality, there's no indication of how small verses such as these expressed in two lines the explosion of new freedoms for women. By placing the poems into safe, pastel-colored, greeting-card context, she leaves readers with a false portrait of who the poet was. (Poetry. 9-12) -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Learning that a mysterious female reporter has vanished from the same area, and convinced her husband&#39;s disappearance is no accident, she enlists the help of his friend, Lawrence Malcolm, a member of Australia&#39;s secret service. In search of answers, they set off, bringing along as translator Kamla. Joanna saved Kamla from an Indian brothel - or flash house - but Kamla is wise in ways that elude Joanna, and soon it is unclear who is saving whom. Their journey through the northernmost reaches of India and over the treacherous Karakoram mountain passes is harrowing and heartbreaking. Suddenly, nothing is as it appears, and as one cruel revelation follows another, this unlikely band finds courage, strength, and unexpected passion in their midst. But will they be strong enough to endure the ultimate betrayal?</p><p>Aimee Liu was an associate producer of NBC&#39;s Today show before becoming a full-time writer. She has written more than ten fiction and non-fiction books, and is currently President of PEN USA. She lives in Los Angeles with her husband and two sons.Set in tumultuous post-WWII Asia, Liu's third novel (after Face and Cloud Mountain) is a sweeping espionage thriller that traces a woman's efforts to find her husband after he disappears into the back country of Communist China in 1949. Joanna Shaw, who runs a rescue agency for Asian prostitutes in New Delhi, offers asylum to a 10-year-old rape victim named Kamla. Shortly afterwards Joanna is notified that her husband, Aidan, a journalist who has been targeted by J. Edgar Hoover for alleged Communist sympathies, has gone missing after a plane crash in Kashmir. Convinced that Aidan is alive, Joanna sets off with her husband's friend, Malcolm Lawrence, and Kamla as their interpreter to find Aidan, but their quest hits a dead end after they discover the body of the female journalist with whom Aidan apparently was traveling. As her prospects of locating Aidan fade, Joanna begins an affair with Malcolm, but soon learns that her new lover had a key role with Aidan in an espionage operation, as a result of which Aidan may have defected to China. Liu tracks the shifting alliances of Aidan, Joanna and Malcolm with surefooted storytelling and solid characterization, and introduces layers of suspense rooted in provocative political secrets. The ending is a crescendo of bittersweet revelations, in which Liu's ability to probe issues of East versus West rises to a new level.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Knitting Simple Jackets: 25 Beautiful Designs</h2><p>All knitters want to create something attractive that shows&nbsp; off their skills&#x2014;and beginners and intermediates who have little time and patience for difficult patterns will love these 25 simple, wearable jackets.

Inspired by Krafft-Ebing&#39;s study of sexual perversity, Psychopathia Sexualis, it purports to be &#34;the literary remains of George Archibald Bishop, a neuropath of the Second Empire.&#34; Crowley&#39;s infamous first book, White Stains was clandestinely printed in 1898 by Leonard Smithers. Of the one hundred numbered copies that were originally printed, only a handful were spared destruction by Her Majesty&#39;s Customs; an outcome which speaks against Crowley&#39;s decision to invoke the blessing of the Virgin Mary in his prefatory sonnet. Crowley would go on to establish himself as a leading figure in the Western occult tradition. A drug addict, bisexual, and proponent of sex magick, Crowley&#39;s flamboyantly impious lifestyle would lead the tabloid press to crown him &#34;The Wickedest Man in the World.&#34;</p><p>Aleister Crowley (born Edward Alexander Crowley; 12 October 1875 &#x2013; 1 December 1947) was an English occultist, ceremonial magician, poet, painter, novelist, and mountaineer.

George Platt Lynes was the preeminent celebrity portraitist of his day, shooting for Vogue and Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar and creating distinctive photographs of iconic cultural figures such as Diana Vreeland, Salvador Dal�, and Orson Welles. But he also produced a separate body of work, kept largely hidden during his lifetime: photographs of the male nude. Many of these photos were shot in the studio and, like his fashion and dance work, were painstakingly posed and lit. They have a cinematic allure that evokes 1940s Hollywood and the lost era of New York&#x2019;s caf� society. Many seem to illustrate some unwritten mythology. Others reveal private obsessions of the photographer, who was always alert to the sculptural qualities of a young man at his most vital. This is the only Platt Lynes book to focus on the male nude images in a comprehensive and carefully considered manner. It is the first book to be published with the cooperation of the artist&#x2019;s estate, which has provided unprecedented access to institutional and private collections, including the Kinsey Institute and the Guggenheim Museum.

Less than a foot in front of her stood Benito Mussolini. As he raised his arm to give the Fascist salute, the woman raised hers and shot him at point-blank range. Mussolini escaped virtually unscathed, cheered on by practically the whole world. Violet Gibson, who expected to be thanked for her action, was arrested, labeled a &#x201c;crazy Irish spinster&#x201d; and a &#x201c;half-mad mystic&#x201d;&#x2014;and promptly forgotten. </p><p>Now, in an elegant work of reconstruction, Frances Stonor Saunders retrieves this remarkable figure from the lost historical record. She examines Gibson&#x2019;s aristocratic childhood in the Dublin elite, with its debutante balls and presentations at court; her engagement with the critical ideas of the era&#x2014;pacifism, mysticism, and socialism; her completely overlooked role in the unfolding drama of Fascism and the cult of Mussolini; and her response to a new and dangerous age when anything seemed possible but everything was at stake.</p><p>In a grand tragic narrative, full of suspense and mystery, conspiracy and backroom diplomacy, Stonor Saunders vividly resurrects the life and times of a woman who sought to forestall catastrophe, whatever the cost.</p></p><p><p>Frances Stonor Saunders is the author of T<i>he Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters</i>, which was short-listed for the <i>Guardian</i> First Book Award, received the Royal Historical Society&#x2019;s Gladstone Memorial Prize, and was translated into ten languages.

She lives in London.</p><p>PROLOGUE: NOW</p><p><i>Wednesday, 7 April 1926 </i></p><p>A glance. Duration one, possibly two, seconds. In particle physics, an eternity. In history, the briefest of encounters, an infinitesimally small exchange. Two arms are raised, Benito Mussolini's in the Fascist salute, Violet Gibson's in the leveling of a pistol. The distance separating these two people, who have never met, is approximately eight inches. Close enough to breathe each other's breath. Murder can be a very intimate business. </p><p>Violet, the daughter of a peer, looks like a pauper. She is wearing a black dress, shiny with wear; her gray-white hair is pinned up in an erratic bundle with straggles that have fallen loose; she is very thin. Mussolini, the son of a blacksmith, is dressed like a stockbroker. Butterfly collar, black tie, spats, overcoat with velvet-trimmed collar&#x2014;clothes picked out that morning by his Jewish mistress, who has spent the night with him. He hasn't slept very well, on account of a suspected stomach ulcer that causes him frequent discomfort. (Away from the crowds, it has become an everyday reflex for him to loosen his trousers and knead his stomach with his hands.) Violet, who has been preparing to kill Mussolini for some time now, hasn't slept well either, because she too suffers from stomach pains. </p><p>Until she raises the pistol and points it at Mussolini's face, it's been a normal Fascist morning. At eight o'clock Quinto Navarra, Mussolini's valet, arrived at his apartment in the Palazzo Tittoni on via Rasella. Shortly after, they got into a black Lancia and were driven to Mussolini's office at Palazzo Chigi. His Excellency the Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, <i>Il Duce</i>, sat behind his desk, receiving his proconsuls and listening to their petitions. His staff and security services have been fine- tuning his schedule, issuing detailed orders for its flawless execution. The chief of police has just completed Security Order number 08473, detailing policing arrangements for the following day. Carbon copies of these security orders are dispatched daily to those responsible for public order, including the heads of the military and political police, the Interior Ministry, and the royal protection squad. The chief of police has to cope with a poorly trained force that has no efficient telephone system, an almost complete lack of motor transport, and cramped and unhygienic local police stations. In a few hours, he will have to revise the order substantially. But, for the moment, everything is running as it should in the new Roman imperium. </p><p>Violet, in the meantime, is making her way from via Nomentana, a broad avenue of villas and apartments extending across what had been, until recently, a rural hinterland of Rome. Does she walk? Does she take the tram? Violet has no staff to draw up and attend to the minutiae of her schedule. As the nuns at the convent where she is lodging will later testify, Violet rose at six and appeared, veiled, for Mass in the convent chapel. She went out after breakfast, at 8:30 a.m. She was a little agitated, "as if she was trying to control some inner emotion." Asked if she would be back for lunch, she answered yes, with "a half-smile." Sister Riccarda was concerned. In the night, she had taken Violet some medicine for her stomach pains. The nun noticed that she had been reading an Italian newspaper and had marked up some passages. "I didn't realise that tomorrow I would have to be out for such a long time," Violet said, her meaning, as always, elusive. As she sets out from the convent, she is unaware that the mother superior, Mary Elizabeth Hesselblad, is watching her closely from a window. </p><p>Violet passes through Porta Pia, Michelangelo's great travertine portal, and heads toward the Church of Santa Susanna. Here, three days ago, on Easter Sunday, she attended Mass, seated beneath florid frescoes depicting the martyrdom of Susanna, the third-century saint who had consecrated her virginity to Christ. Violet, though not a virgin, is ready to embrace her own martyrdom, because God has willed it so. In her right hand, which is tucked into a pocket, she carries a Lebel revolver, the standard-issue weapon of the French military, capable of firing six 8mm rounds loaded into a swing-out chamber. She has wrapped it in her black veil. In her room at the convent, where she has been practicing with the empty revolver, gripping it with both hands for a steady aim, she has a box of twenty live bullets. In the left pocket of her spinsterly dress she carries a large stone, concealed in a black leather glove, with which she will smash the windshield of Mussolini's car should she need to shoot him in the vehicle. These are the implements of her saintly gest. </p>WHAT THE TOURISTS SEE <p>Classical Rome, medieval Rome, renaissance Rome, baroque Rome, eighteenth-century Rome, postunification Rome. Foreign visitors (an estimated 150,000 of whom have arrived in the city to celebrate Easter) are venturing forth from hotels and <i>pensioni</i> to pace out their routes across all these Romes, two thousand years of history and confused memories squashed into rubble or sculpted onto soaring masonry. For many tourists, it's the last chance to rummage through their Baedeker or Murray's <i>Handbook of Rome</i> before beginning the exodus home. Edith Wharton loathed these "red volumes which accompany the traveller through Italy," because they had "so completely anticipated the most whimsical impulses of their readers that it is now almost impossible to plan a tour of exploration without finding, on reference to them, that their author has already been over the ground." But Violet's impulses carry her along on a trajectory unmeasured by any guidebook. </p><p>Fascist Rome, great gusts of Roman glory, the sense of what Virginia Woolf identified as "an age to come of pure, self- assertive virility." The "unmitigated masculinity" of the new Rome is personified by its leader, Benito Mussolini, whose "muscles" and "extraordinary vitality" are a delight to Lady Asquith, wife of the former British prime minister (who offers, by contrast, an unconstructed physique and indoor skin). An estimated thirty million pictures of <i>Il Duce</i> in up to 2,500 different poses are in circulation. He has been photographed swimming, fencing, boxing, riding, cutting corn shirtless, his chest glistening with sweat&#x2014; unimaginable for most of his political contemporaries. Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Baldwin, Chamberlain, Roosevelt, Blum, and Franco are not visibly "men" in this way, timidly keeping their bodies as private concerns. Mussolini's body, it is said, leaves "after-images" of itself to arouse the faithful. Clementine Churchill, meeting <i>Il Duce</i> in March 1926, found him "quite simple and <i>natural</i>, very dignified . . . [with] beautiful golden brown, piercing eyes which you can see but can't look at." As if looking at him were like looking at the sun. All in all, she concluded, "one of the most wonderful men of our times." She was delighted to take away a signed photograph in memento. Lady Oxford described his sonorous voice as one of the most beautiful she had ever heard. Lady Ivy Chamberlain, wife of Foreign Secretary Sir Austen, was an enduring fan who treasured her own Fascist Party badge (and, while they lasted, the orchids Mussolini sent her). Lady Sybil Graham, wife of the British ambassador, Sir Ronald, was said to be equally charmed. </p><p>Tourist guides advise that Mussolini himself is among the sites to visit. "Everyone who came to Rome wanted to have an interview with Mussolini," observed an American journalist. "To see him was as much a part of the long-planned trip to the Eternal City as it was to visit the ruins or to walk over the places where the heroes of antiquity had once walked." Women travelers dream of tea with Mussolini&#x2014;though he doesn't drink it, except for chamomile, which he takes both orally and through the rectum, as a palliative for his stomach pains. </p><p>Sister Caterina Flanagan will testify that Violet had watched an official pro cession in September 1925 but came back indignant because Mussolini had not appeared. This was not surprising, the nun explained (ignorant of Violet's intentions), as many foreign guests at the convent who were great admirers of Mussolini "were constantly trying to catch a glimpse of him, and were disappointed if they failed." How ridiculous, muses Foreign Secretary Dino Grandi, are these "elderly widows and elderly deracinated ladies"&#x2014;<i>pace</i> Miss Jean Brodie, a woman in her prime&#x2014; who adore <i>Il Duce</i> and long to give him seedcake. </p>WHAT THE TOURISTS DO NOT SEE <p>They do not see the political prisoners, the castor oil, the <i>manganello </i>clubs, weighted with thick leather or lead; or the body of the murdered opposition leader Giacomo Matteotti, left to rot in a ditch outside Rome; or the three thousand dead and buried, bludgeoned or knifed or shot by Fascist squads. The tourists, as they settle into their wagon-lit trains (fully booked three weeks in advance, on account of Easter), do not see the prisoners transported to <i>confino</i>, internal exile, in cattle cars attached to third-class trains, chained, handcuffed, without food or air. The tourists do not see the smashed bones on the corpse of the anti-Fascist Catholic priest Don Giovanni Minzoni; or the contusions and internal bleeding of Socialist Party leader Giovanni Amendola, savagely beaten by Fascist thugs in July 1925. His broken body will never recover. Nine months later, on this very day, Wednesday, 7 April 1926, it is cooling on a slab in a hospital morgue in Cannes. A normal Fascist morning. </p><p>The inflation of Mussolini is continuous and pervasive. All newspapers are obliged to give prominent place to his articles and speeches; typesetters have to print the word <i>DUCE</i> in capital letters. There is a rush on gold paint and leaf, for decorating the lictors' maces and fasces and Roman eagles and the throne that is being constructed for Mussolini to sit upon during the ceremony, in a few days' time, to mark his elevation as "Caesar of the Modern Empire." The fascination and v�lan of Fascism; but at its heart lies a rancor, a nervous fear. The regime is permanently readying itself for "the muster, the march, the battle, the liquidation of foes who paradoxically never [lose] their menace . . . for another conflict, another test." Mussolini gives "fighting" speeches. "War" is declared against cabbies, who are told they must shave ("Edict Bans Whiskers and Prescribes Hat, Collar and Tie"); against women who are dressed in "immodest garb"; against bachelors who refuse to go forth and multiply little Fascists. On the walls of thousands of buildings Mussolini's historic slogans are daubed in indelible black varnish: <i>Credere, Obbedire, Combattere</i> (Believe, Obey, Fight); "Mussolini is always right"; "We shall shoot straight." </p><p>Violet knows how to shoot a pistol, having once used one on herself. But her aim might be a problem, as the bullet she fired into her body a year ago&#x2014;"I wanted to die for the glory of God"&#x2014;missed her heart and whizzed through her ribcage before coming to a halt in her shoulder bone. </p><i>CAPUT MUNDI </i><p>At 9:30, after a meeting with the Duke d'Aosta, a cousin of the king, Mussolini is driven the short distance from Palazzo Chigi to Campidoglio, the Capitoline. He isn't wearing the bowler hat his mistress handed to him before he left his apartment&#x2014;too much, perhaps, under a brilliant April sun. (He later abandons the use altogether, when he realizes that bowlers are worn by Laurel and Hardy in the Hollywood comedies he so enjoys watching.) He gets out of the car at the foot of the wide, shallow steps leading up to the capitol of the capital of the world, and ascends them at full tilt, leaving his personal secretary huffing and puffing behind him. This place is the center&#x2014;political, religious, administrative&#x2014;of all Romes. If Mussolini has his way, it will be the center also of the new Roman Empire. </p><p>Michelangelo's exquisite geometry: a three- sided piazza of peach-colored buildings in the middle of which Marcus Aurelius rides his bronze horse, centuries of stormy events swirling at his feet. On the west side is the Palazzo dei Conservatori, which Mussolini enters through the main door. He proceeds along the dizzying marble corridors, his heels clacking like castanets against the stone. In the Sala degli Orazi e Curiazi, he mounts the podium and launches into the inaugural speech of the Seventh International Congress of Surgeons. Hundreds of surgeons listen with satisfaction as Mussolini praises their art and thanks them for their many interventions on his own body after bits of it had been blown off or shattered in the Great War. The storm of steel that hit him was a misfired shell he himself had loaded, leaving him with scores of fragmentation and puncture wounds, a smashed right collarbone, a temporarily paralyzed left arm, and a severe laceration in his right leg which became infected, requiring an agonizing scraping procedure down to the marrow of his shinbone. As it turns out, these have proved to be useful wounds, virtuous punctuation marks in the progress of a modern savior as he advances toward his triumph. </p><p>One early biographer of Mussolini wrote, in <i>Dux</i>, that he had so many war wounds he seemed like "Saint Sebastian, his flesh pierced as if with arrows." The author was Margherita Sarfatti, who as Mussolini's mistress was well qualified to trace the intimate details of his body. Mussolini collected near-death experiences like generals collect medals: duels (he fought at least two in 1919, and one in 1920), plane crashes (in March 1921 a plane he was piloting nosedived suddenly and crashed; he emerged with only scratches to his face and a twisted knee). And explosives. Shortly before the March on Rome, in October 1922, a bullet grazed his ear when a euphoric <i>squadrista</i> fired his gun into the air. As a newspaper editor in Milan, Mussolini used to keep several bombs and hand grenades on his desk, "in case his political enemies should attack him," reported <i>Time</i> magazine. Once, while writing an editorial, "he set fire to the fuse of one of these bombs by accidentally resting his cigarette upon it. An assistant noticed the smoldering fuse, screamed. Looking up, Editor Mussolini snuffed it out with his fingers, continued the writing of his editorial." "I like to live dangerously," Mussolini was fond of saying. </p><p>Violet approaches Campidoglio. Perhaps the large crowd gathered there draws her to the place. This is not on her itinerary for today, not the scene she has chosen for a fatal encounter with Mussolini. In her pocket is a tiny scrap of paper, the tip of the lip of an envelope, on which she has written "Palazzo del Littorio," the address of the Fascist Party headquarters where, according to the newspaper she has been reading, <i>Il Duce </i>will appear that afternoon. On Campidoglio, she approaches a tall, bearded man and asks if the king is present. No, not the king. Mussolini. She threads her way through the crowd and positions herself by one of the two lampposts just outside the Palazzo dei Conservatori. Nearby are two uniformed policemen. Directly in front of her are the liveried marshals of the capitol in stiffly brocaded silk coats and plumed bicorn hats. Plainclothes secret agents are everywhere...</p></p><h2>Can&#39;t Stop Loving You</h2><p><p>When it comes to her heart, Arabella D&#x2019;Angelo has moved on&#x2014;even though she still lives in Mirror Lake, Connecticut, a little tourist town with a long memory for mistakes.

And nowhere is bamboo used more elegantly and distinctly than in Japan. Its presence touches every part of daily life-art, crafts, design, literature, and food. Its beauty enlivens textile designs, restaurant interiors, and holiday festivities.<br><br>Artist and writer Nancy Moore Bess set out to discover just how bamboo-crafted objects attained such heights in Japan. Her travels took her throughout the country and through centuries of accumulated artifacts. After five years of dedicated research and study, she has assembled an unparalleled collection of writings and photographs that uncover the hidden beauty of bamboo.<br><br>Bess unveils the boundless uses of this versatile material in Japan, ranging from the most elegant and refined to the most humble. She shows bamboo's applications in the garden and home, in the cherished accessories of the tea ceremony and flower arranging, and in an endless array of crafts from elaborate baskets to colorful kites and dolls.<br><br>With illuminating text and over 250 exquisite photographs, illustrations, and artwork, Bess reveals the intricacies and resources of this lovely versatile plant. She explores the Japanese reverence for bamboo's natural beauty, adding immeasurably to our knowledge of the Asian sensibility and lifestyle.<br><br>[AN ON-LINE INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR] <br>Q. Could you tell us a little about your background?<br><br>A. I am fond of saying that I'm a basketmaker from California. It is true, but ... I have lived on the east coast more years than those early, influential ones in California. I learned to make baskets on 8th Avenue in New York City. Basketry is the focus of my professional life. I weave, teach, and exhibit. No matter where I travel, I find basketmakers and a conversation begins. Much of my first trip in Japan (11 months in 1986-87) was devoted to meeting basketmakers and watching them work.<br><br>Q. What motivated you to write this book? / What got you started?<br><br>A. When I first wrote the book proposal, I was thinking only of those basketmakers I had met in Japan - how hard they worked, how varied their baskets, how ubiquitous basketry was in Japan. As the book topic broadened to include ALL of bamboo in Japan, I found that I had much to learn, and the research began. Each interview led to more library work. Each book in the library led to more interviews. It was a never-ending circle for five years. I still can't resist a good book that reveals something new to me about bamboo in Japan.<br><br>Q. Could you tell us a little about the contents of the book?<br><br>A. The main thesis of the book is that bamboo touches every aspect in daily life in Japan, even in urban Tokyo or Osaka. At first, everyone tends to think this is an overly 'romantic' approach; however, upon more careful examination (or reading of <em>Bamboo in Japan</em>), it becomes clear that, unlike other single 'material' in Japan, bamboo is linked to everything - language, ritual, home life, food, design, art, and crafts. Other plants are important, pine and rice straw, for instance. But they don't have both the symbolism AND the practical use, it is 'either/or.' Only bamboo touches the everyday and the elegant, the practical and the elite, the farmer and the urban housewife. Only bamboo can go from kitchen zaru to the artwork of Living National Treasures.<br><br>Q. What do you see as the centerpiece of the book? / Why is the book important?<br><br>A. The marriage of text and illustration makes <em>Bamboo in Japan</em> successful. This bond allows the reader to penetrate the book at many different levels - one can look at the illustrations, read only the captions, dive into one section or all. All the text and illustrations are tied to the main thesis - bamboo touches every aspect of daily life in Japan - so the impact is considerable.<br><br><em>Bamboo in Japan</em> is important, in part, because it hasn't been done before. Earlier English-language books on the topic of bamboo covered part of the story, but not all. This book offers everyone a chance to really read about this incredible plant in Japan and its many guises. Bamboo enchants, and Bamboo in Japan lets the reader experience this.<br><br>Q. What did you yourself learn from writing the book?<br><br>A. So many things ... some personal and emotional. I learned that I can't do everything, but I can be persistent and decide my priorities. I knew I was attracted to bamboo as a craft material, but I didn't realize how passionate I would become about bamboo as a plant. I'll never stop reading and learning about bamboo and never stop being an advocate for bamboo workers.<br><br>Q. What would you like readers to take away with them after reading this book?<br><br>A. I'd like people to acknowledge the bamboo craftspeople for their skill, vulnerability, and dedication. I'd like everyone to look to other cultures with an open mind and heart. I'd like them to walk down a lane in Japan and SEE the bamboo.<br><br>Q. What people or books were influential in the writing of your book?<br><br>A. The Japanese publications about bamboo and crafts were an amazing resource. I only wish I could read them myself and not have to rely on sections being translated for me. That separation between me and the information is troubling. I always think there is one more book I need to read, one more craftsperson I need to talk with, one more garden I need to photograph ... then I'll be on top of it. The bamboo enthusiasts in both Japan and the USA were amazing. We all share a common passion, and they were generous with information and, sometimes, funding. The Japan Bamboo Society in Kyoto was especially helpful, as was The American Bamboo Society here. I'd still be writing if ABS hadn't helped me out with grants!<br><br>Q. What are your plans for the future, in terms of new books or other projects?<br><br>A. I don't think I'll ever stop the research on bamboo. At the moment, I am concentrating on gathering information about bamboo as a 'motif' in folk tales around the world. I suspect that will be my next book. However, the link to Japan will not be broken. I try to assist others who want to do research there; I keep in touch with bamboo folks there and with basketmakers; I get back whenever I can scramble together the money for a ticket. There is nothing like the feeling of flying into Narita or arriving on the night train into the bamboo region of Beppu - that expectation of yet another wonderful bamboo moment!<br><br>Q. Is there anything else the reader should know?<br><br>A. Find something you are passionate about and pursue it. Or borrow my passion, bamboo in Japan, and immerse yourself in another world.</p><p>AN ON-LINE INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR <p>Could you tell us a little about your background? </p><p>"I am fond of saying that I'm a basketmaker from California.

The theme of the book is that investment is simpler than non-professionals think it is in that the rudiments can be expressed in ordinary English, and picked up by anybody. It is not a science. But investment is also difficult. People on the outside tend to think that anyone on the inside should be able to do better than the market indices. This is not so. Picking the managers who are likely to do better is a challenge. Richard Oldfield begins with a candid confession of some of his worst mistakes and what they have taught him. He discusses the different types of investment, why fees matter, and the importance of measuring performance properly. He also outlines what to look for, and what not to look for in an investment manager, when to fire a manager, and h</p><p>Richard Oldfield is chief executive of Oldfield Partners LLP, which manages equity portfolios for families, trusts, charities, endowment funds and pension funds with an approach the firm describes as long-only, concentrated, value-focused, and index-ignorant....the best practitioners book since Barton Briggs&#39;s &#39;Hedge Hogging&#39;...an expert, extremely readable real-life tour through the main features of the investment landscape&#34;&#34; -- Alistair Blair &#34;&#34;Investors Chronicle&#34;&#34;</p><h2>Death Trick: A Murder Mystery</h2><p>It's 1979, the height of the post-Stonewall era of gay sexual liberation, and a young man has been brutally murdered. The gay son of a wealthy family has disappeared. Now it's up to private dick Don Strachey to get to the bottom of this mess--even if he has to cruise every gay bar in the city to do it! <p>Don Strachey isn't exactly the most sought-after private eye in Albany, New York. In fact, this gay P.I. has gotten to the point of having to write checks to pay his tab at the cheapest lunch counter in town. And he isn't sure that the latest one, for the grand total of two dollars and ninety-three cents, is going to clear. Then the phone rings. Billy Blount, the gay heir to one of Saratoga Springs' upper-crust families, has disappeared, and his parents want him back. On top of that, Billy, a young and outspoken gay activist, is wanted for the grizzly murder of the man he slept with on his last night in Albany--a man he'd never met before that night! </p> <p>Set in the glorious, promiscuous pre-HIV late 1970s, Death Trick is a fast-paced excursion through the seamy underside of gay Albany. From gay discos where the hard-pumping music never stops, to the city's infamous baths, to the dark alley behind the local precinct house, this hard-bitten private dick searches for answers to the questions that plague Billy's parents and the police. </p> <p>With his faithful companion (and unfaithful lover) Timmy plus a cast of characters that includes drag queens, ex-jock gay bar owners, homophobic cops, male hustlers, and wealthy suburbanites, Strachey begins a chase that leads him to seedy gay bars, posh suburban homes, and pricey mental institutions where they use electric shock to destroy "sick" gay tendencies. </p> <p>Armistead Maupin describes Death Trick as "sassy and sexy" and calls Don Strachey, "a private dick who really earns his title." The New York Native calls the novel, "more than just a first-rate murder mystery." The Advocate said, "a great lazy-day read." And Newsday called the book, "well written and compelling." </p> <p>Don't you owe it to yourself to take this trick home tonight?</p></p><p>"A great lazy-day read." -- <i>The Advocate</i><br><br>"More than just a first-rate murder mystery." -- <i>The New York Native </i><br><br>"Well written and compelling." -- <i>Newsday </i><br><br>Death Trick is one of a select group of mysteries that I reread every couple of years. Its Chandler-esque wisecracks always make me laugh and its late 1970s picture of raucous and exuberant gay nightlife always makes me mourn anew the brevity of that pre-AIDS golden age. In Death Trick, Richard Stevenson, like his contemporaries Robert B. Parker and Sara Para Paretsky, began transforming the traditional politics of the hard-boiled form. -- <i>Maureen Corrigan, Book Critic, "Fresh Air," National Public Radio</i><br><br>Of all the gay mystery writers of the past twenty years, Richard Stevenson is the most underestimated but may be the best of the lot. His books are wise and witty and in Don Strachey he has created a wonderful character who is a lot less dour than most private investigators and a lot more fun to spend time with. I'm glad to see him back in action." -- <i>Michael Nava, Author of the Henry Rios mysteries</i></p><h2>Hapkido: Korean Art of Self-Defense</h2><p>Hapkido, "The Way of Coordination and Internal Power," is one of the three major Korean martial arts. Founded in 1963 by Master Choi Young-Sul, it is a complete system of self-defense, encompassing, striking, kicking, and grappling techniques. Conceptually, Hapkido techniques more closely parallel those of Aikido than Taekwondo.

In a few months Romania will join the European Union. Meanwhile, the northern Italian town of Turin has been rocked by a series of deadly crimes involving Albanians and Romanians. Is this the latest eruption of a clan feud dating back centuries, or is the trouble being incited by local organized crime syndicates who routinely &#x201c;infect&#x201d; neighborhoods and then &#x201c;cleanse&#x201d; them in order to earn big on property developments? Enzo Lagan�, born in Turin to Southern Italian parents, is a journalist with a wry sense of humor who is determined to get to the bottom of this crime wave.

All the extraordinary earthenware figures illustrated here have been recovered from burial sites and shaft tombs. They represent a wide range of subjects - warriors, chieftains, ladies, acrobats, shamans, musicians, ball players, festival couples and bound prisoners - in a variety of styles from about 200 BC to AD 800 - that compose the artistic canon of Ancient West Mexico, a region encompassing the modern states of Colima, Jalisco and Nayarit.</p><p>This beautiful and impressively researched book accompanies an exhibit organized by the Art Institute of Chicago. Editor Townsend is curator of the institute's Department of African and Amerindian Art and author of The Aztecs (Thames &amp; Hudson, 1993), among other titles. The book's 15 essays, written by an international group of experts, explore the art, archaeology, and cultural and political history of the region while demonstrating connections to other Mesoamerican cultures and influence on major 20th-century painters and sculptors. The essays are supplemented by 446 illustrations, maps, chronological charts, site plans, and tomb reconstructions.

Between the end of World War I and the Nazi rise to power, Germany&#x2019;s Weimar Republic (1919-1933) was a thriving laboratory of art and culture. As the country experienced unprecedented and often tumultuous social, economic, and political upheaval, many artists rejected Expressionism in favor of a new realism to capture this emerging society. Dubbed Neue Sachlichkeit&#x2015;New Objectivity&#x2015;its adherents turned a cold eye on the new Germany: its desperate prostitutes and crippled war veterans, its alienated urban landscapes, its decadent underworld where anything was available for a price. Showcasing 150 works by more than 50 artists, this book reflects the full diversity and strategies of New Objectivity. Organized around five thematic sections, it mixes photography, works on paper, and painting to bring them into a visual dialogue. Artists such as Otto Dix, George Grosz, and Max Beckmann are included alongside Christian Schad, Alexander Kanoldt, Georg Schrimpf, August Sander, Lotte Jacobi, and Aenne Biermann. Also included are essays that examine the politics of New Objectivity and its legacy; its relation to international art movements of the time; the context of gender roles and sexuality; and the influence of new technology and consumer goods.</p><p>Stephanie Barron is a Senior Curator and heads the Modern Art department at the Los Angeles Contemporary Museum of Art.

The occupation of much of Europe in particular left huge areas that could be exploited. Partisans, spies and saboteurs risked everything in a limbo where the normal rules of war were usually suspended. Concealment of oneself, one&#39;s weapons and equipment, was vital, and so were the new methods and hardware which were constantly evolving in a bid to stay ahead of the Gestapo and security services. Silent killing, disguise, covert communications and the arts of guerrilla warfare were all advanced as the war progressed. With the embodiment and expansion of organisations such as the British SOE and the American OSS, and the supply of special forces units which operated behind enemy lines, clandestine warfare became a permanent part of the modern military and political scene. Perhaps surprisingly many of these hitherto secret techniques and pieces of equipment were put into print at the time and many examples are now becoming available. This manual brings together a selection of these dark arts and extraordinary objects and techniques in their original form, under one cover to build up an authentic picture of the Allied spy.</p><p>Dr Stephen Bull is the Curator of the Museum of Lancashire in Preston.

Cave diving is the natural evolution of caving, where cavers and open-water divers overcome the challenges of water-filled passages by using specialist breathing apparatus to explore further and deeper than ever before. The challenges are many - distance, depth, temperature, visibility, rockfall and simple restriction in passage size - together with the physical and mental demands placed on an individual in an environment where, despite meticulous preparation, equipment can malfunction and one cannot expect to be rescued if something goes wrong. Early cave dives were made using Standard Equipment diving suits, before &#39;frogman&#39; equipment was adopted by British and Italian divers in the 1940s. Around the same time, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Emile Gagnan designed the compressed-air aqualung , the first scuba equipment. The development of breathing apparatus has continued, alongside solutions to evermore challenging projects, especially those at extreme depth. British cave divers, including the author, have been at the forefront of many developments, such as the explorations at Wookey Hole in the Mendips, Keld Head in the Yorkshire Dales and Pozo Azul in Spain. Cave diving today is a truly international endeavour, and Farr gives detailed and engaging accounts of developments in Europe, the Americas, Australia and New Zealand, Southern Africa and more. Farr introduces cave diving&#39;s pioneers and chronicles their achievements. Among a cast of many are the Britons Graham Balcombe and Mike Boon ; the American Sheck Exley , who died while attempting to establish a new depth record in the Zacaton sinkhole in Mexico; and the outstanding German cave diver and equipment innovator Jochen Hasenmayer . The stories of their adventures are charged with courage, danger and excitement, and some have led to tragedy. First published in 1980, this 2017 edition of The Darkness Beckons has been fully revised and updated to reflect the latest developments. Featuring over 400 breathtaking photographs and illustrations , and with a foreword by renowned American cave diver and explorer Bill Stone , it is an inspirational read for anyone with an interest in exploration and adventure.</p><p>Martyn Farr is an internationally renowned caver and cave diver and is responsible for the discovery of many miles of subterranean wilderness. He has been caving from the age of ten, discovering new caves from the age of sixteen, and his life has been dominated by an elemental passion for exploration. Martyn began cave diving in 1971 and by 1981 had established a world record for undersea cave penetration in the Bahamas. In the UK he is known for his explorations in Wookey Hole, in 1977 and 1982, and the first subterranean traverse of Llangattock Mountain in Wales in 1986. He has made many expeditions worldwide, to Iran, Mexico, Borneo, China, Dominican Republic, Japan, France, Spain, the Canary Islands, the Balearics, Greece, Turkey, Brazil, Russia, Australia and, most recently, New Zealand. Age has not diminished his enthusiasm or powers of endurance. In November 2012 he explored over a mile of new cave in South Island, New Zealand, and in 2013 and 2014 he made further solo discoveries of similar magnitudes in the same area. Original and exciting explorations are ongoing in Wales and Ireland. Martyn has worked as a cave diving instructor for many years and remains as passionate as ever. His photographic work has appeared in many magazines and newspapers, including The Sunday Times, The Guardian and Daily Mail, and he has written eight books on this esoteric subject. He has helped produce any number of films and programmes for television and radio and taken countless celebrities underground, including princes William and Harry. He lives in Crickhowell, South Wales.</p><h2>Mugs Meals, Treats &amp; Sweets</h2><p>The perfect solution for a quick meal, family treat, or fun food.&nbsp;Whether seeking a microwavable, oven-baked, or no-bake food, you'll find many recipes that are ready to make and eat in a flash.<ul><li>Choose from nearly 100 recipes sure to please</li><li>Recipes for breakfast, meals, drinkable soups, incredible edibles, quick cakes, treats and sweets, and even hot and cold sippers are included</li><li>Each includes a full-color photo</li></ul>Hardcover concealed spiral book</p><p></p><h2>Marvel&#39;s Avengers: Age of Ultron: The Junior Novel (Marvel&#39;s the Avengers: Age of Ultron)</h2><p>Following the record-shattering successes of <i>Marvel's The Avengers</i> in 2012, The Avengers must reassemble on the big screen to combat the robotic menace of Ultron! <i>Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron</i> is set for US release on May 1, 2015. <br><br>Acclaimed writer/director Joss Whedon and producer Kevin Feige return, along with the all-star cast of Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/Hulk), Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/Captain America), Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow) and Jeremy Renner (Clint Barton/Hawkeye).

An Executive&#39;s Guide to Using Probabilistic Thinking to Manage Risk and to Make Better Decisions</h2><p>Subtitle: An Executive&#39;s Guide to Using Probabilistic Thinking to Manage Risk and to Make Better Decisions. Patrick Leach draws on his extensive consulting and teaching experience to present a compelling, insightful, and understandable case for using probabilistic analysis as part of every day business decision-making. Practical examples and case studies are clearly presented.</p><p>Mr. Leach is an experienced conference speaker, business trainer, and consultant. He makes a clear, concise case for appropriate implementation of probabilisitic analysis. Rather than get bogged down with equations and complexity, he shares his insight and the benefits of his experience (and some key research by others) in a way that is readable, useful, and memorable.Executives routinely make major decisions in the face of high uncertainty. In fact, managing risk and uncertainty is one of the key functions of any senior manager. Techniques for estimating the probabilities of multiple scenarios (and the impact of those scenarios) have existed for years, yet many of the men and women in executive positions do not understand how to use the results of these analyses appropriately.<p> This book supplies that understanding in language that non-statisticians can understand. The emphasis is on the practical; real-life examples illustrate the key points throughout the book. Example topics include: why major projects are so often late and over budget, when to spend money on more information (and when not to), the benefits of a risk-neutral approach, psychological weaknesses humans have when dealing with uncertainty, and tools to use and traps to avoid.</p></p><h2>1022 Evergreen Place (Ceder Cove)</h2><p>The The New York Times and USA Today best-selling author presents this 10th installment in her highly popular Cedar Cove series. (General fiction).</p><p>Debbie Macomber, the author of Hannah&#x2019;s List, 1022 Evergreen Place, Summer on Blossom Street, 92 Pacific Boulevard, and Twenty Wishes, is a leading voice in women&#x2019;s fiction. Three of her novels have scored the #1 slot on the New York Times, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. Debbie Macomber's Mrs. Miracle was Hallmark Channel's top-watched movie for 2009. Winner of the 2005 Quill Award for Best Romance, the prolific author has more than 140 million copies of her books in print worldwide.<br><br>Almost home. Grateful for the end of his shift, Mack McAfee turned the corner onto Evergreen Place and approached his house, the duplex at 1022. He felt an instant sense of peace when he saw Mary Jo Wyse working in the garden, taking advantage of the longer days and the perfection of a Pacific Northwest spring. At six, the sun was still bright and the sky had the clean-washed look of early May. Mack had to smile as he watched Mary Jo. The young single mother was his tenant, his friend&#x2014; and the woman he'd fallen for. Hard. Lovely as ever, she wore jeans and a pink, long-sleeved top that clung in all the right places. Noelle was asleep in a stroller a few feet away.<br><br>Mack had delivered the baby last Christmas&#x2014;or assisted in her delivery; that was probably a better way to put it. He'd just joined the Cedar Cove Fire Department and as the most recent hire, he'd pulled duty on Christmas Eve. It'd been a quiet night until the call from the Harding ranch. A woman said she was about to give birth. Mack had taken a medical course and received his emergency medical technician certificate, but nothing he'd learned had prepared him for the exhilaration of being at a delivery. The moment little Noelle drew her first breath she'd completely won him over.<br><br>Noelle <em>and </em>her mother had laid claim to Mack's heart.<br><br>Mack parked on his side of the driveway and climbed out of the truck. He was outwardly calm, but his thoughts were in chaos. He hadn't seen either of them in two days.<br><br>With his help, Mary Jo had planted a small garden, which she tended daily. "Hi," she said, getting up from her knees. She brushed the dirt from her pant legs and glanced at him with a shy smile.<br><br>"Hi," he responded. Afraid that Mary Jo would be able to interpret his feelings, he studied the neat row of green seedlings that had begun to poke through the earth. Mary Jo was still suspicious of men, thanks to her experience with David Rhodes, although Mack was making a serious effort to gain her trust. "The garden's starting to take shape, I see."<br><br>He crouched down and peeked at Noelle, who slept contentedly with one small clenched fist raised above her head. The baby mesmerized him. For that matter, so did Mary Jo....<br><br>"I...missed seeing you the past couple of days," she said in a low voice.<br><br>That was encouraging. "You did?" He hated to sound too eager since he was treading carefully in this relationship. He'd made a big mistake with her and was almost afraid of what would happen next.<br><br>"Well, yes. The last time we talked, well...you know."<br><br>Mack straightened and nervously shoved his hands in his back pockets.<br><br>"You told me it wasn't a good idea for us to continue with the engagement," she said, although he didn't need any reminder.<br><br>"That seemed for the best," he muttered. "But&#x2014;"<br><br>Before he could qualify his remark, she broke in. "And you're right, it <em>is </em>for the best, especially if you don't love me."<br><br>Mack couldn't believe he'd actually said that. "No, I just thought&#x2014;"<br><br>"I understand," she said, cutting him off again. "You proposed because you were trying to protect me."<br><br>Mack studied her through narrowed eyes. "You didn't hear from David Rhodes again, did you?"<br><br>"No." She shook her head emphatically.<br><br>Noelle's biological father had threatened, more than once, to take the baby from Mary Jo, which Mack felt was nothing more than a bluff. But it had frightened her so badly that she'd panicked and decided to move back to Seattle. Back to her brothers, who'd look after her and the baby.<br><br>Afraid he was about to lose them both, Mack had suggested marriage. Mary Jo had accepted, with the stipulation that they have a six-month engagement.<br><br>That wasn't the <em>only </em>stipulation. She'd insisted there be no physical contact. That was when Mack had realized his mistake. Mary Jo's sole reason for moving to Cedar Cove had been to escape her domineering older brothers. In offering to marry her, Mack was doing exactly what they'd done. His motive had been to keep a close watch over her, to protect her. Because he loved her, yes, but without recognizing it, he'd assumed the role her brothers had played in her life. No wonder Mary Jo had stalled their relationship.<br><br>A few days after they became engaged, he noticed the shift in her attitude. No longer did she treat him as her friend. No longer could they tease and joke and affectionately kiss. He'd taken control of a situation in <em>her </em>life, squelching Mary Jo's first tentative efforts toward independence. She'd said yes to his proposal, but it wasn't because she loved him.<br><br>A month passed before Mack figured out what was wrong and why he had to break off the engagement. In his eagerness to be with her, to marry her, he'd nearly ruined everything.<br><br>At least neither of them had mentioned the engagement to their families. For his part Mack knew his parents would've seen through his reasons immediately. They would've said it was too soon, pointing out that Mack and Mary Jo didn't know each other well enough to make that kind of commitment.<br><br>They would've been right.<br><br>Mack had acted on impulse, his desire to protect her overcoming his better judgment. He needed to bide his time and let the relationship progress naturally.<br><br>One problem was his lack of finesse with women. Not that he was totally naive, but none of his relationships prior to meeting Mary Jo had been serious or long-lasting.<br><br>He did have a sister&#x2014;two sisters, actually. Only he hadn't known about the second one until a few years ago. He'd always been close to Linnette and had now begun to develop a friendship with Gloria.<br><br>Linnette had often advised him on relationships, but she'd moved to some Podunk town in North Dakota. They managed regular phone conversations; despite that, Mack hadn't been smart enough to seek her opinion before he proposed to Mary Jo.<br><br>In trying to undo his mistake, Mack had committed another one. He'd broken off the engagement by telling Mary Jo that although he was fond of her, his real love was for Noelle.<br><br>It'd seemed like a reasonable approach at the time. He'd hoped to back out of the engagement and save face as he did&#x2014;let her save face, too. Instead, he'd further complicated an already complex relationship. If there'd been a worse way to handle the situation, he couldn't imagine it.<br><br>What he should've done was simply be honest. Whoever said honesty was the best policy&#x2014;Ben Franklin? Mother Teresa? Bill Clinton? Oprah?&#x2014;was absolutely correct.<br><br>Then the following morning, Mack had been on duty at the fire station. He'd felt uncomfortable and anxious about seeing Mary Jo ever since. This was their first encounter since that day.<br><br>"I don't expect to hear from David again," Mary Jo was saying. "Like you said, I think it was an empty threat. He only wants Noelle so he can manipulate his father into giving him money."<br><br>Mack nodded. "If you do see him, call me and I'll deal with him." As soon as the words were out, Mack wished he could take them back. The whole point of breaking off the engagement was to let Mary Jo solve her own problems.<br><br>Instead of responding, she occupied herself with rearranging Noelle's blanket.<br><br>Mack rocked back on his heels and removed his hands from his pockets. He wanted to groan. Why couldn't he keep his mouth shut? "I guess I should check the mail," he said with a sigh. He'd just headed over to the mailbox when Mary Jo called him back.<br><br>"I learned something about those letters."<br><br>"Letters?" Mack asked in confusion.<br><br>"The ones I found under the floorboards in the closet."<br><br>That box of World War II letters had completely slipped his mind. "Tell me," he said quickly.<br><br>"I'd rather show you."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>"Would you like to come by for dinner?" she asked. She bit her lip, as if she wasn't confident that inviting him was such a good plan, after all. "I don't want you to feel any obligation...."<br><br>"No, I want to," he said with more enthusiasm than he'd intended. "I mean, if you're sure about having me over."<br><br>"I am."<br><br>Mack checked his watch. "It's quarter after six now. Shall we say in an hour?"<br><br>"An hour," she agreed.<br><br>His spirits lifted. Maybe he <em>hadn't </em>ruined everything the way he'd feared. "See you then," he said with a relieved smile.<br><br>"Okay." She smiled back, and he felt a sudden hopefulness.<br><br>Not until he was on his porch steps did it occur to him to ask if there was anything he could contribute. A salad? No, wine was probably better. He turned and, to his surprise, found Mary Jo watching him. Looking guilty, she glanced away.<br><br>"What can I bring?" he asked. "For dinner."<br><br>She gave a half shrug. "I've got chicken-and-vegetable stew in the Crock-Pot and I'm making biscuits. I can't think of anything else."<br><br>"How about a bottle of wine?" When she nodded, he said, "See you around seven."<br><br>After collecting the mail, Mack let himself into his side of the duplex, closed the door and breathed deeply. His sense of excitement was nearly overwhelming. In less than an hour he'd have a chance to make up for the foolish, clumsy way he'd ended the engagement&#x2014;with a lie. He'd have a chance to start again, to reestablish their relationship on a more equal footing.<br><br>Fifteen minutes later, Mack had showered, shaved and changed clothes. He threw a load in the washing machine and set the dials. With another half hour to kill, he walked restlessly from room to room. This evening was important, and it could set the tone for many evenings to come.<br><br>In the past he'd often visited Mary Jo and Noelle. She'd regularly invited him over but not, he now suspected, out of any great desire for his company. Mary Jo was simply accustomed to having people around. Until recently she'd lived with her three older brothers.<br><br>She'd cooked for her family, although Mack knew they did their share of household chores. She was used to preparing meals for three hungry men; no wonder she always made enough to feed a family. So it was easy to invite an additional person, Mack told himself. She didn't make extra with him in mind.<br><br>Not that he was complaining. Far from it. He liked spending time with her, being part of her life. Entertaining Noelle&#x2014;that was his job most nights. He held and played with the baby while Mary Jo finished dinner preparations, and then later, they sat together and watched television or played cards. She had card sense, as his father would've put it. They talked, too, but not about anything deep or too personal. They'd talk about what they'd read or seen on TV, or mutual friends and acquaintances in Cedar Cove. Both were careful to avoid religion and politics, although he guessed they held similar views.<br><br>At the end of the evening, he'd kiss her good-night. After their so-called engagement, those kisses had become more brotherly than playful or passionate. That was what had initially convinced him the engagement was all wrong.<br><br>Considering the way David Rhodes had treated her, he understood that Mary Jo would be wary of entering a new relationship. Her trust in men&#x2014;and in her own ability to judge them&#x2014;had been badly shaken. But surely she'd come to recognize that Mack was a man of his word. That he genuinely cared for her and the baby and would never do anything to bring them harm.<br><br>He worried that he wasn't as good-looking as Rhodes. He wasn't as smooth, either, but that probably didn't attract Mary Jo anymore, not after being involved with a player like David. Unlike Rhodes, Mack wasn't tall, dark and handsome. He was just under six feet and his brown hair had a hint of auburn in it, which accounted for the sprinkling of freckles across the bridge of his nose. He was an average guy, he supposed. He might work for the fire department, but he doubted anyone would select him for one of those hunk calendars.<br><br>Mary Jo, however, was beautiful. He wasn't surprised that someone like David Rhodes would notice her. Mack had long decided that her beauty was part of the problem; it put her out of his league. He was sure she could have her pick of any man she wanted. All Mack could hope for was that, given enough time, she'd want <em>him.</em><br><br>When he knocked at her front door, Mary Jo immediately opened it, almost as if she'd been waiting for him, although that was unlikely to be the case. Noelle cooed from her seat and waved her arms, and he chose to see that as a greeting just for him.<br><br>"How's my girl?" he asked. He handed Mary Jo the bottle of chilled pinot grigio he'd taken from his fridge, then walked into the living room and reached for the baby. As he lifted her in his arms he grinned at Mary Jo. "I've only been away a couple of days and I swear she's grown two inches."<br><br>"She changes every single day," Mary Jo said. "I see it, too."<br><br>He tickled Noelle's chin and she gurgled back, which made him laugh.<br><br>"There are those World War II letters," Mary Jo said, pointing at the coffee table.<br><br>Mack looked away from Noelle long enough to glance at the cigar box sitting there. He could tell it was faded and a little shabby. "How many letters were inside?"<br><br>"Dozens. It didn't seem like that many when I found them, but the paper is really thin."<br><br>She'd been enthralled by her discovery. Mack was interested, too&#x2014;who wouldn't be? These letters were a direct link to history, a personal connection to some of the most momentous events of the previous century.<br><br>"The article I read on the internet called this paper onionskin and it said the letters were referred to as V-mail." She smiled at that. "I think the <em>V </em>stands for <em>victory.</em>" She sat on the sofa and Mack joined her, still holding the baby. He divided his attention between Mary Jo and Noelle.<br><br>"I've read them twice. They're addressed to Miss Joan Manry."<br><br>"I remember." Mack recalled the recipient's name, now that she mentioned it, although not the sender's. He cocked his head but couldn't read the return address. "Who are they from?"<br><br>"His name is Jacob Dennison and he was a major stationed in Europe during the war. Some of his letters have black marks on them, but a lot of them don't have any at all. I assume those marks were put there by censors. You know, I read that there were over two hundred censorship offices. Their job was to ensure that military personnel didn't reveal anything sensitive in their letters." She paused. "Of course, that doesn't explain why these letters were hidden."<br><br></p><h2>Year Of Wonders - A Novel Of The Plague</h2><p><i>Year of Wonders</i> is historical fiction of the highest order--absolutely convincing in its period detail, filled with full-blooded characters who arouse one's deepest empathy, and driven by a story of striking immediacy. In 1665, the north of England remains untouched by the plague that is ravaging London. Then, in a small, close-knit community of lead miners and hill farmers, a bolt of cloth has no way of knowing that the damp fabric carries within its folds the deadly bubonic infection. Confronted with a scourge beyond remedy or understanding, the villagers turn in desperation to sorcery, herb lore, and murderous witch hunting--to no effect. Finally, led by a young and charismatic preacher, they elect to isolate themselves in a quarantine that may only deepen the tragedy. Told through the eyes of hard-working, inquisitive Anna Firth, who at age 18 must conten<i>d with the loss of her family and the disintegration of her community, Year of Wonders</i> explores love and learning, fear and fanaticism, and the struggle of science and religion to interpret the world on the cusp of the modern era.</p><p>Geraldine Brooks's <i>Year of Wonders</i> describes the 17th-century plague that is carried from London to a small Derbyshire village by an itinerant tailor. As villagers begin, one by one, to die, the rest face a choice: do they flee their village in hope of outrunning the plague or do they stay? The lord of the manor and his family pack up and leave. The rector, Michael Mompellion, argues forcefully that the villagers should stay put, isolate themselves from neighboring towns and villages, and prevent the contagion from spreading. His oratory wins the day and the village turns in on itself. Cocooned from the outside world and ravaged by the disease, its inhabitants struggle to retain their humanity in the face of the disaster. The narrator, the young widow Anna Frith, is one of the few who succeeds. With Mompellion and his wife, Elinor, she tends to the dying and battles to prevent her fellow villagers from descending into drink, violence, and superstition. All is complicated by the intense, inexpressible feelings she develops for both the rector and his wife. <i>Year of Wonders</i> sometimes seems anachronistic as historical fiction; Anna and Mompellion occasionally appear to be modern sensibilities unaccountably transferred to 17th-century Derbyshire. However, there is no mistaking the power of Brooks's imagination or the skill with which she constructs her story of ordinary people struggling to cope with extraordinary circumstances. <i>--Nick Rennison, Amazon.co.uk</i>"Geraldine Brooks's <i>Year of Wonders</i> is a wonder indeed: a marriage of language and story unlike anything I have ever read. The novel gives the reader a remarkable glimpse into a 17th century horror, but does so with both compassion and exuberance. Read it for the inventiveness of the language alone -- a genuine treat." (Anita Shreve, author of <i>The Pilot's Wife</i> and <i>The Last Time They Met</i>) <p> "Geraldine Brooks' impressive first novel goes well beyond chronicling the devastation of a plague-ridden village. It leaves us with the memory of vivid characters struggling in timeless human ways with the hardships confronting them-and the memory, too, of an elegant and engaging story." Arthur Golden, author of <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</i></p><p>"I honestly cannot recall the last time I read a novel as riveting, haunting, and authentically rendered as <i>Year of Wonders</i>. This book is astonishing, a small wonder itself." (Chris Bohjalian, author of <i>Midwives</i> and <i>Trans-Sister Radio</i>)</p><p>"Witch-like, Geraldine Brooks transports the reader to a small English village of the 1660s where over half the population is succumbing to the plague. As alive as a Breugel painting, <i>Year of Wonders</i>offers the vitality and variety of lives strangely like our own--precious and passionate. An unforgettable read, this splendid novel enriches our human memory of both despair and courage."(Sena Jeter Naslund, author of <i>Ahab's Wife; or, the Star-Gazer</i>)</p></p><h2>The Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain Kidd</h2><p>Everybody knows the legend of Captain Kidd, America's most ruthless buccanneer. Few people realize that the facts of his life make for a much better tale. Kidd was actually a tough New York sea captain hired to chase pirates, a married war hero whose secret mission took a spectacularly bad turn.<br><br> This harrowing tale traces Kidd's voyages in the 1690s from his home near Wall Street to Whitehall Palace in London, from the ports of the Caribbean to a secret pirate paradise off Madagascar. Author Richard Zacks, during his research, also unearthed the story of a long forgotten rogue named Robert Culliford, who dogged Kidd and led Kidd's crew to mutiny not once but twice. The lives of Kidd and Culliford play out like an unscripted duel: one man would hang in the harbor, the other would walk away with the treasure. Filled with superb writing and impeccable research, <em>The Pirate Hunter</em> is both a masterpiece of historical detective work and a ripping good yarn, and it delivers something rare: an authentic pirate story for grown-ups.</p><p><strong>Richard Zacks</strong> is a graduate of the Columbia Journalism School, a former syndicated columnist for the <em>New York Daily News</em>, and a freelance journalist for <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, <em>Time</em>, the <em>Village Voice</em>, <em>London Times</em>, <em>Life</em>, and other publications.Zacks takes the thrilling historical figure of Captain Kidd and makes his story even more dazzling by presenting the realities of buccaneer life, warts and all. Michael Prichard's expert delivery enhances these details, as does his spirited delivery of a pirate ditty. It's interesting to learn that Kidd was not the cutthroat he is often portrayed to be but rather a kind of bounty hunter. Zacks has a knack for presenting information that is fascinating--whether or not you're interested in pirate lore. Prichard maintains a sense of irony as the story moves to its conclusion. This is a perfect choice for anyone who enjoys armchair adventure.

His droll and ironic composite photocollages, installations, and videotapes have shed new light on the nature of perception, meaning, and interpretation.Conceptual artist Baldessari&#x2019;s latest book (after The Metaphor Problem Again) looks a bit like a high-end impulse buy: every few pages there are manipulated photos of food and eaters; in between one can find short essays and stories by famous folks. The broad theme of food holds the whole party together, allowing Paul Auster&#x2019;s memories of poverty in his young adulthood (excerpted from The Red Notebook) to rub shoulders with musician David Byrne&#x2019;s intriguing but abruptly curtailed thoughts on "knifeless eating" and writer John Haskell&#x2019;s short story "Toast." Art critic Peter Schjeldahl contributes a meandering essay on "taste" and Glenn O&#x2019;Brien tosses in memories of his halcyon days in Andy Warhol&#x2019;s New York, offering such insights as "Madonna had funny ideas about wine" and "when Max&#x2019;s Kansas City closed... the abstract painters all had tabs in the five figures... The figurative painters were much more modest in their spending." The best of the group may be David Gilbert&#x2019;s scathing satire "How to Cook a Turkey," in which a mother gives cooking instructions to her family and, in the process, reveals all her resentments and fears. Baldessari&#x2019;s photographs, many of which seem to be film stills, are edited and cropped so as to obscure the subjects&#x2019; faces and shift the focus to the ritual of eating. This unusual perspective adds to the slightly menacing quality of the book, which should appeal to the artist&#x2019;s fans but may leave other readers more uneasy than sated.

In 1898, when Maisie turns 17, her visit marks a turning point. On the morning after her arrival, local fishermen make a gruesome discovery: two drowned lovers, found clasped in each other's arms. It's only the first in a series of events that cast a shadow over Maisie's summer. As she considers the attentions of two very different young men, one an adventurous writer, the other an ambitious businessman from her father's company, Maisie also falls under the gaze of Miss Grange, who begins to tell her stories of her past. But which are truth and which are fiction? Another death, a cache of diaries, an exchange of letters--and a ghostly apparition--all play a part in changing Maisie's life forever.<br><br>Rich with the details, customs, and language of the era, GRANGE HOUSE is part family saga, part ghost-story, part love story; a wonderfully atmospheric, page-turning novel of literary suspense and romance. <br></p><p>Sarah Blake is a graduate of Yale University and New York University, where she received her Ph.D. in Victorian literature. She lives in Evanston, Illinois.<br>&nbsp; Grange House<br>VOLUME I<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;CHAPTER ONE<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;If you have come for a long stay, you must arrive at Grange House by water. The House sits at the farthest edge of the harbor from Middle Haven town, the last habitation before the harbor gives way to the open sea, and though a road runs between the town and Grange House, it is narrow and rocky&#x2014;entirely unsuitable for the conveyance of large families with luggage. Rather, you must take the night steamer from Boston, which deposits you at the Grange House pier before teatime.I like to stand in the prow of that boat, steaming farther and farther north and east, and be the first to feel the air sharpen and cool, leaving the damp heat of Boston, the shipyards at Portsmouth, and voyaging into the clear silence born in the chill air of Maine. And though I watch for it, I am never prepared for the first sight of Grange House on its point, though I know the approach, and early learned to read where the slick black shale ledges of the shoreline turn to the white granite boulders marking the entrance to Middle Haven&#x2019;s harbor.If you have arrived this way, most likely you are what the native people like to call a rusticator, a city dweller come for the cooler air of the north. From the pier, the steamer&#x2019;s side appears lined with such visitors as she draws near, and the captain brings her along at a smart clip. Then he gives the engineer two bells and a jingle and guides her right in. You can see the mate now, waiting with the forward spring line in his hand before he tosses that hawser neatly over the piling just as the bow nudges alongside. He holds it, straining, and she&#x2019;s in against the pier with hardly ajar. You are arrived into a mayhem of unloading, the wharf dipping below the weight of trunks and summer guests. There you stand, surrounded by the men&#x2019;s cries and the groaning creak of the steamer&#x2019;s lines straining against the pier; and then you turn and look up the lawn to the House, set high and away, atop its granite foundation.In such a way, I came again to Grange House in July of 1896, this place at once familiar and always strange. Long ago, my father had invested in the Grange quarry, but then the place itself took hold. When the quarryman&#x2019;s mansion turned hotel to a few select city families, he fixed the habit of returning every year, though Mama protested, bemoaning the distinct lack of variety in a landscape of spruce and pine. Nonetheless, the enormous old house suited the high pitch of my nerves that summer. At seventeen, I was as eager to know the world as it seemed eager to shroud itself from me, and fretful at what I thought were my bonds, I had begun to wear my white dresses like flags, a slim Crusoe signaling for the distant triangle of sails to break the flat line of what appeared to me but an endless, dulled sea.As I followed behind my father and mother, I looked up at the top of the House to see if I might spy a figure there watching our advance up the lawn from the windows of her attic room. I never thought of Grange House without that figure standing in it. That afternoon, I did not see her, but, hoping she still looked for my return, I held my gloved hand up in a small salute.&#x201c;Maisie,&#x201d; Mama called from the top stair of the verandah.&#x201c;I am here,&#x201d; I replied, dropping my hand down to my side, but she had already swung round to follow my father across the threshold into the House, not lingering to take in the view. I cast one last glance upward, and then, gathering my skirts, took the remainder of the lawn with quick feet.My parents were stopped just inside, next to Mrs. French, the long, wide front hallway stretching past them, with its several doors to the public rooms swung open and the hubbub of teatime voices issuing into the air. It was ever so, year after year: here in the front hall the mix of salt air and cut bayberry, the branches stuffed into matching copper pots upon the table, the silvery green leaves waxy as ever against the paper roses upon the wall. It was only I who seemed to change, a knife cut in the vergeless surface of the place, my arrival cleaving one summer from the next. And that afternoon in July, I remember thinking I was like the Prince returning to the Sleeping Beauty&#x2019;s castle. Let the story begin, I thought impatiently, now that I am here&#x2014;though what I meant by that, I had not the slightest idea.&#x201c;Well, well, my dear!&#x201d; the housekeeper cried out on seeing me upon the threshold, and she beamed the compliment over to Mama, who smiled absently, pulling off her gloves.&#x201c;Are we to have our usual rooms, Mrs. French? I am quite in need of a little rest.&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes, of course. Please, Mrs. Thomas, to follow me.&#x201d;&#x201c;Welcome, Thomases,&#x201d; a quiet voice spoke from the doorway just behind Papa. We all three turned round, to see the cook of Grange House standing silently there, her arms crossed over her bosom. Mama gave only the briefest of nods before turning to follow Mrs. French, who waited at the bottom of the stairs.&#x201c;Cook.&#x201d; Papa bowed kindly to the woman.&#x201c;Good afternoon, Mr. Thomas,&#x201d; she answered, dismissing him as she leaned slightly back against the door frame and turned her gaze upon me. Papa never seemed to mind the cook&#x2019;s inexplicable command of their encounters, and I had by now grown accustomed to this woman&#x2019;s yearly scrutiny. Yet that afternoon, I relished the chance to consider her in turn, and I calmly lifted my eyes to hers and smiled.For an instant, I thought she shivered.&#x201c;Maisie Thomas,&#x201d; she said, swiftly uncrossing her arms, &#x201c;how you have grown.&#x201d; And without another word, she withdrew.Never mind, I thought, a bit disconcerted, she is not the important one. For though it was Cook who ran Grange House from belowstairs, and Mrs. French who held public sway in the middle rooms and floors, nonetheless it was the topmost figure&#x2014;she whom I had watched for on our arrival&#x2014;who was the possessing spirit of the place. I dressed quickly for dinner that evening, descending before my parents to station myself at the foot of the stairs and there await the attic inhabitant of Grange House. And long after the other guests had assembled, passing me by with a nod and a greeting, and after Mama and Papa had issued through to join them, it was she whom I now imagined descending the wooden attic stairs from her room at the top of the House to reach the servants&#x2019; hall upon the third floor, then down the next stairs into the regions of the second floor, where the large rooms of her family&#x2019;s time had been changed to accommodate we summer people come to stay. Then on down the widest stairway, into the bright, hospitable lights of a fashionable hotel shining its face up for the rush and hum of dinner, into the clap and shiver of bodies just cased in new dresses and thin suits, into the soft mayhem of summer evenings&#x2014;when our lives might suddenly thrill, and open.&#x201c;Miss Grange!&#x201d; I smiled up.She caught her breath on seeing me and paused in her descent.&#x201c;Maisie Thomas.&#x201d;Though there was pleasure in her voice, the deep-sunk blue of her eyes regarded me with a touch of bewilderment. I supposed she saw what my mirror told: My cheeks now held the shape of a woman&#x2019;s face, and beneath the dark brown eyes turned to welcome her lay the secret longings of my untried heart. I had caught Mama watching me furtively, as though she read a hidden chapter in my familiar face, and even Jessie&#x2014;who had dressed and tended me since I was a girl&#x2014;exploded forth from time to time despite herself, ripping out the seams of my bodices and commenting dryly about &#x201c;welcome attentions.&#x201d;&#x201c;Miss Grange?&#x201d; I hesitated.She recovered herself. &#x201c;How greatly you resemble your father,&#x201d; she replied, and drew her hand beneath my arm so we proceeded together into the hum of the bright gathering.Miss Grange was something of an enigma for the summer guests. She did not own the hotel, yet she inspired a curious respect. When she did choose to come among us, she was greeted as a visiting dignitary, or even as a monarch long exiled from the proceedings of her own court. It is not to be thought that she was important in any pertinent way. Rather, her magnificence derived from the fact of her lineage. Hers was a family whose roots were among the first to stretch down into American soil. No one knew precisely her connection to the men who had built this House, but it was commonly assumed she was a distant and poor relation who had come here to live after the main branch of the family passed away. Thus, her romance derived from her situation: She was the last Grange remaining. The history of her family preceded her into the very rooms it had built and peopled and vanished from long before the summering plutocrats arrived at the fortunes that brought them here.And among the younger guests, there were the whispered rumors of buried wealth, the half-uttered suggestions of a lost love, of a secret pact into which she had entered when she came into the House. Once, Papa told me that she had been an authoress, yet surely none of her stories could rival the stew pot simmering at the back of the guests&#x2019; imaginations. Thus was Miss Grange cast as a living character in the casual entertainment of city folk seeking simplicity under the sharp lines of a Maine sky. Simplicity, that is to say, inmixed with a good country intrigue.&#x201c;Here is Miss Grange,&#x201d; I said, drawing her to where my parents conversed, and Mama and Papa turned round. Mama&#x2019;s mouth opened into the vague and generous smile she always gave when her thoughts tended elsewhere, but Papa took Miss Grange&#x2019;s hand in his, visibly startled.&#x201c;But&#x2014;you are not well?&#x201d;Miss Grange stiffened, and, withdrawing her hand gently, she nodded but did not reply.&#x201c;Really, Ludlow,&#x201d; Mama interposed. &#x201c;Forgive him, Miss Grange. You look wonderfully well, as always,&#x201d; and she drew her hand beneath Papa&#x2019;s arm, turning him as the dinner bell sounded. Gallantly, he offered his other arm to Miss Grange, who did not take it but walked at his side into the dining room.That night, several of the other guests had gone to a supper party being held in a neighboring hotel, so the dining room was laid with quite diminished table settings, and our little group joined the two solitary diners already seated at our customary table: Mr. Cutting&#x2014;the illustrious and tiresome schoolmaster, whose head gleamed in the gaslight like a polished knob where he sat, starched napkin at the ready, his spoon poised in his hand, awaiting his soup&#x2014;and the large and definitively unaccompanied Mrs. Hunnowell. It would seem, she informed us without prelude, that she was <i>utterly</i> abandoned. Her husband had returned to Boston for the week&#x2019;s business, and <i>where</i> Bartholomew might be, she really couldn&#x2019;t say, her eyes rolling indulgently at the empty chair beside her. I smiled. Year after year, Mrs. Hunnowell did not disappoint, remaining the kind of woman whose conversation consisted mainly of melodramas she concocted, her head tilted upward, as if the endings hovered just above us in the painted heavens of the room.I took the abandoned chair beside her, knowing full well that Bartholomew, her son, could never be depended upon to be in the ordinary place at the ordinary time. Having penned a series of very successful travel books for those on their grand tour, Mr. Hunnowell proceeded through life, appearing and disappearing very much like the kind of train he advised young men to catch&#x2014;off schedule and bound for unknown parts. Mama entirely disapproved of his unsettled behavior&#x2014;a man of thirty, after all! Even as I could not dismiss him so entirely, I did find him disquieting. One never knew with him precisely where one stood&#x2014;or rather, where he stood. For every summer he appeared among us, breezy and refined, playing a wide array of roles&#x2014;brave gallant, avid sportsman, irreverent parlor man&#x2014;and then a sometimes Bedouin intensity would flash out amongst the parts, making him unreadable, provokingly so.&#x201c;After all,&#x201d; Mr. Cutting&#x2019;s musing broke in, &#x201c;the day turned out to be fine.&#x201d;Mama nodded politely at him, and as Mrs. Hunnowell motioned the serving girl forward to begin, I put aside all thoughts of Bart Hunnowell and his character.Amid the clatter of the serving of the soup, I studied Miss Grange across the table. Though she could not be more than fifty, the winter past seemed to have settled an elderly gray upon her cheeks, and a blue vein pulsed too brightly upon her hand. Papa was right. There <i>was</i> something shifted, for I do not think I imagined the heavy sadness deep down in Miss Grange&#x2019;s eyes, now giving them the kind of deathly beauty of a poem: <i>Pale beyond porch and portal</i>, I repeated to myself, <i>Crowned with calm leaves she stands</i>. She caught my eye upon her and winked. I reddened and looked down. I have been reading too much Swinburne, I thought, and smiled to myself.&#x201c;Will you please to just look at that?&#x201d; Mrs. Hunnowell breathed beside me, and I caught the erstwhile rose hip slip from behind her ear, to fall upon the broad pavilion of her bosom.I followed her gaze out the side window, where, indeed, a fleet and incomplete tableau had formed of the sort the summer guests most appreciated. Now a man&#x2019;s uncovered head leaned down to whisper into the ear of a young woman. From where we sat, the woman stood too small for us to see more than just the gentle swell of her forehead, though her hand had flown up to rest upon the back of the man&#x2019;s neck.And then in an instant, they had parted. But just as the young man turned, I caught sight of his face.&#x201c;Henry Brown!&#x201d; I said aloud.&#x201c;But who is the girl?&#x201d; wondered Mrs. Hunnowell, delighted. I did not reply. Yet something of the tilt of her head had called to mind Halcy Ames, I realized a bit wistfully, watching Henry Brown&#x2019;s sturdy back and shoulders advance without haste down the lawn toward his boat, oblivious to the rapt attention we paid his small encounter.I could not think of Halcy Ames without a twinge of regret, for once upon a time we had been staunch companions, though she was Cook&#x2019;s daughter and I a guest. As a child, she had done light maid&#x2019;s work at Grange House in the mornings, filling each guest room&#x2019;s fireplace with new wood and making fresh the beds upstairs. Younger than I by two years, she was pretty in her way&#x2014;tiny, her hands completing her tasks as efficiently as wood squirrels about their trees, and I grew accustomed to accompanying her as she went about the beds, fetching clean linens and smoothing spreads at her command.Then one day, she was tidying my mother&#x2019;s dressing table, straightening the glass bottles and brushes on its marble top, and I was pulling Mama&#x2019;s scarves from her dresser drawer. We were busy talking, standing side by side, looking at each other in the looking glass above the table, resembling nothing so much as sisters that morning, our two small faces animated and dancing as we talked&#x2014;so we did not hear Mama&#x2019;s hand on the knob, but when she suddenly spoke from behind us, Halcy jumped so, she knocked one of Mama&#x2019;s perfume bottles off the table. It made a terrific noise, shattering into several tiny pieces at our feet.&#x201c;Oh! You clumsy girl!&#x201d; Mama exclaimed. &#x201c;Just see what you have done!&#x201d;I leapt stoutly to Halcy&#x2019;s defense. &#x201c;But you startled us, Mama.&#x201d;&#x201c;A good serving girl, Maisie, must learn to be always on the ready for the entrance of her mistress without event. Fetch a broom, please, Halcy, and clear this away.&#x201d;Ha...</p><h2>Regeneration (Penguin Celebrations)</h2><p>&nbsp;<b>"The trilogy is trying to tell something about the parts of war that don't get into the official accounts" &#x2013;Pat Barker</b><br> <br> <b>The first book of the Regeneration Trilogy and a Booker Prize nominee</b><br> &nbsp;<br> In 1917 Siegfried Sasson, noted poet and decorated war hero, publicly refused to continue serving as a British officer in World War I. His reason: the war was a senseless slaughter. He was officially classified "mentally unsound" and sent to Craiglockhart War Hospital. There a brilliant psychiatrist, Dr. William Rivers, set about restoring Sassoon's "sanity" and sending him back to the trenches. This novel tells what happened as only a novel can. It is a war saga in which not a shot is fired. It is a story of a battle for a man's mind in which only the reader can decide who is the victor, who the vanquished, and who the victim.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the most amazing feats of fiction of our time, <i>Regneration </i>has been hailed by critics across the globe.&nbsp; As August 2014 marks the 100-year anniversary of World War I, this book is as timely and relevant as ever.</p><p><b>Regeneration</b>, one in Pat Barker's series of novels confronting the psychological effects of World War I, focuses on treatment methods during the war and the story of a decorated English officer sent to a military hospital after publicly declaring he will no longer fight. Yet the novel is much more. Written in sparse prose that is shockingly clear -- the descriptions of electronic treatments are particularly harrowing -- it combines real-life characters and events with fictional ones in a work that examines the insanity of war like no other. Barker also weaves in issues of class and politics in this compactly powerful book. Other books in the series include The Eye in the Door and the Booker Award winner The Ghost Road.<b>PAT BARKER</b> has earned a place in the first rank of contemporary British writers with such novels as <i>Union Street</i>, <i>Regeneration</i> (shortlisted for Britain's prestigious Booker Prize and chosen by the <i>New York Times</i> as one of the four best novels of 1992), <i>The Eye in the Door</i> (winner of the 1993 Guardian fiction prize), and <i>The Ghost Road</i> (winner of the 1995 Booker Prize). The latter three novels are available in Dutton hardcover and Plume paperback editions. Pat Barker lives in Durham, England.</p><h2>Hidden faces</h2><p>Dali&#39;s only novel. In richly visual language Dali describes the lives and loves of a group of aristocratic characters who, in their beauty, luxury, and extravagance, symbolize the decadent Europe of the 1930s. The story of the tangled lives of the protagonists, from the February riots of 1934 in Paris to the closing days of the war, is a brilliant vehicle for Dali&#39;s ideas, and an evocation of pre-war Europe. Valuable not only for Dali&#39;s own specially drawn illustrations, but also because it synthesizes all of the themes in Dali&#39;s art. So full of visual invention, so witty, so charged with an almost Dickensian energy that it&#39;s difficult not to accept its author&#39;s own arrogant valuation of himself as a genius.&#34;&#34; - The Observer.</p><p><b>Salvador Dal� </b>(1904&#x2013;1989) remains one of the most popular and recognizable painters of the 20th century. <b>Haakon Maurice Chevalier</b> (1901&#x2013;1985) was an American author, translator, and professor of French literature at the University of California, Berkeley.&nbsp;<b> </b>Text: English, Spanish (translation)</p><h2>Guide to the Amphibians and Reptiles of Japan</h2><p>Guide to the Amphibians and Reptiles of Japan covers all the herpetologically significant islands of the Japanese archipelago.

By means of his numerous workshops that he conducted throughout the world, Jack Capon has shown how teachers and others interested in Movement Education can start their own successful programs. <p>Jack Capon was active in Movement Education from the early 1960's right on up to the mid 1990's when, by an ironic twist of fate, he was forced into early retirement by the onslaught of a rare neurological disorder called Striatonigral Degeneration. In the early stages this disorder mimics the symptoms of Parkinson's disease but later on as it kills off more and more brain cells it forces its host into paraplegic-like conditions. And finally, after several years of deteriorating health, Jack passed away in the summer of 1999 soon after the publication of the newest edition of his Perceptual-Motor Lesson Plans, Level-2 book. But Jack's legacy lives on and thanks to Jack's many workshops over the years and to the continuing great success of his programs, many people have been trained in the Jack Capon method and are quite skilled in advising any of those who are interested in starting, restarting, or continuing his Movement Education programs. People who have been trained in the Jack Capon method and who are willing to offer their advice and assistance are available from the publisher, Front Row Experience. Also available from the publisher, are training videos for teachers and instructors that show Jack's program in action for themselves! </p><p>Jack Capon was not only a great Movement Educator, but a great human being as well, as witnessed by his 25 years of volunteering to direct the Special Olympics Program for his local town of Alameda, California.

It's been told that the original founder of the nationwide and now worldwide chain of Gymboree fitness centers for kids got her inspiration and many of her ideas from observing Jack Capon's programs in action and in attending many of his early workshops. The fact that you can start a business using Jack Capon-like activities for kids is further testament to the obvious that his programs do work and give a valuable boost to the development of any child in the early childhood years. </p><p> Jack Capon was active in Movement Education from the early 1960's right on up to the mid 1990's when, by an ironic twist of fate, he was forced into early retirement by the onslaught of a rare neurological disorder called Striatonigral Degeneration.

Jack Capon, who spent nearly his entire professional career as the Coordinator For Physical Education in the Alameda City School District, Alameda, California, has been appointed to many positions and given many awards and honors over the years recognizing his great achievements in Movement Education and his unselfish volunteer work in his community. From 1968 to 72 he served on the Perceptual-Motor Task Force of the American Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (AAHPERD). He was elected National Chairman of the Elementary Physical Education section of AAHPERD in 1972. The California Association of Health, Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance (CAHPERD) presented him with their State Honor Award in 1978. Around that time AAHPERD presented him with the City and County Director's Honor Award. In 1982 the California Association of School Administrators (ACSA) selected him as the "outstanding Administrator of the Year." He served as the volunteer Director of the Special Olympics Program for 25 years for the town of Alameda, California where he lived and worked. The local Channel 4 TV station in his area honored him in 1992 with it's annual "For Those Who Care" award. The City of Alameda, California, gave him the Citizen of the Year Award in 1993. San Jose State University's College of Applied Arts and Science, San Jose, California, gave him its Distinguished Alumni Award in 1995.

Her treasury of fifty-one recipes demonstrates deliciously just how important the remarkable <i>Zea mays</i> is to southern culture and cuisine. <i>Corn</i>'s recipes emphasize seasonality. High summer calls for fresh corn eaten on the cob or shaved into salads, sautes, and soups. When fall and winter come, it is time to make cornmeal biscuits, muffins, cobblers, and hotcakes, along with silky spoonbread and sausage-studded cornbread stuffing. And the heaviest hitters, cornbread and grits, are mainstays all year round.<br><br>Flanagan also surveys corn's culinary history--its place in Native American culture, its traditional role on the southerner's table, and the new and exciting ways it is enjoyed in southern kitchens today. Appreciating how this oversized grass is capable of providing sustenance in an astonishing array of forms, Flanagan organizes the book to reflect corn's versatility. Sections feature corn in its full glory: fresh on and off the cob, dried and ground, nixtamalized (soaked in an alkaline solution and hulled to make hominy) and popped, and mashed and fermented. From Sweet Corn and Poblano Chowder to Southern Skillet Cornbread, from Fresh Corn Tortillas to Classic Cheese Grits, and from Molasses Caramel Corn with Candied Bacon, Peanuts, and Sesame to New Orleans Bourbon Milk Punch, the dishes range from classic southern to contemporary to globally influenced.<br><br></p><p>Tema Flanagan is a farmer at The Farm at Windy Hill, a sustainable production and teaching farm in Alabama.

She divides her time between Connecticut and Florida.</p><br><br><p>Although Beth Parrott has been knitting for more than 60 years, until recently she designed socks and other garments only for family and for charity projects. She loves to teach and is an avid collector of tricks-of-the-trade and tidbits of information that make knitting easier. She works, plays, knits, and teaches in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>This book lets you peek behind the scenes at secret sock societies--23 women's sock patterns that were originally designed for sock clubs and KALs. There are a tremendous variety of patterns and yarns used. Because independent designers designed the patterns and many of the yarns used are from independent dyers, there is a remarkable variety of patterns. My favorites are Acorn Stash by Anne Hanson, Ariel by Debbie O'Neil and Reims by Alyson Johnson--all wonderfully lacy, complex-ish socks, my personal sock obsession right now. <br><br>A huge, helpful section in this book talks about the different ways to adjust the sock patterns for size. Most sock patterns, in general, are written for one size. These clever authors give us 6 ways to adjust for our own feet from changing gauge by changing needle size to adding a small repeat between pattern repeats. --Jillian Moreno, knitty.com<br><br>This week's review brings me to a new sock knitting book: <i>Sock Club</i> by Charlene Schurch and Beth Parrott. The first thing that grabs me right away are those socks on the front cover. I definitely want to be knitting some of those! Once I opened the book, I found there were many more patterns that I want to knit. In fact, I counted ten patterns that on first glance I wanted to knit. That's a lot of patterns to love in a book of 23 patterns ... I can't think of another sock book I have ever seen that I have wanted to knit so much out of. That's saying a lot, because I am kind of picky when it comes to sock patterns!<br><br>In addition to all those patterns, there are also a few pages on making socks your own size. I always appreciate this kind of information with sock patterns, because I don't think my size 11 feet are going to be shrinking any time soon! Some of the details this section goes into are changing the number of pattern repeats and adding a small motif in between pattern repeats. I also appreciate that the patterns give directions or options for making the socks bigger.<br><br>After all the patterns in the book, there are a couple pages with techniques, useful info, and foot measurements. I was so happy to see the foot measurements in the book. I mean, when you are trying to surprise a friend with birthday socks, it kind of ruins it if you take a tape measure to his or her foot. Hooray for the chart that at least gives you some average numbers to shoot for when knitting those gift socks!<br><br>The other thing that is making me totally in love with this book is the fact that several of the patterns featured indie dyer yarns. Makes me hopeful that someone will be designing sock patterns for books with one of my yarns one day!<br><br>So, I guess it's pretty obvious that I am in love with this book, huh? --Jennifer Hansen, Knitting Like Crazy<br><br>Yes, of course, it IS a book of sock patterns. Twenty-three of them. Most of the patterns were available as part of a "sock club." You know the kind, where a designer or yarn-seller sets up a club where, once a month, every member gets specially-dyed yarn and a brand-new, exclusive pattern, just for the members. Most if not all the patterns in this book saw light of day in just that way.<br><br>Except ... most sock patterns come in one size. Maybe two, but here? The authors tell you right up front that they wanted to do better than that because one has a narrow 5.5-shoe foot, and the other wears a 10.5 EE. They've obviously been frustrated over the years over the lack of fitting patterns and wanted to make sure that the patterns in their book would fit just about everyone.<br><br>So, the patterns themselves not only come in several sizes--most of them, anyway--but they are sorted into groups by what you would need to do to change the size. That's practically unheard of! (In fact, I can't think off-hand of another sock book that does that.) As a perennially "loose" knitter with narrow feet, whose standard stockinette socks are knit over 44 stitches, believe me, it's nice to have someone who's already thought through the sizing options and can give me hints to make socks that actually fit.<br><br>Each sock comes with a "skill level" and gives the finished circumference and size right up front. They cover the gamut of sock methods, too. Cuff-down, Toe-up. Short row heels, traditional flap heels, etcetera, etcetera. That makes for a lot of variety. Most of the patterns come with sidebars with suggestions about how to re-size if necessary, or about construction, how to choose the right kind of yarn for that pattern ... helpful stuff.<br><br>The patterns themselves? Not only are the construction techniques varied, but so are the socks. Lace, cables, color, texture--they are all here. All the socks are for women, in theory, though they could easily be adapted for men, if you so desired. (See? Those sizing options are already coming in handy.)<br><br>The pictures are good knitting-book pictures, in that they show the items in a graceful, tasteful, attractive way, without looking like they're trying to hide something. (I admit that's actually harder to do when photographing socks, but I have seen suspicious sock photos!) The patterns are listed out in the Table of Contents, though there's no Index. The section on techniques in the back is only four pages long, but I think this book assumes you've already knitted a sock or two and focuses on providing new patterns, rather than detailed instruction about the concept of turning a heel--nothing wrong with that.<br><br>My Gush: Creative, attractive, with a nice variety of techniques--plus sizing options. Good book. --Deb Boyken, knittingscholar.com</p><h2>Invincible Iron Man: Fear Itself</h2><p>The machinations of the Red Skull's daughter, Sin, unleashed the long forgotten Asgardian god known only as the Serpent upon Midgard to fulfill an eons-old prophecy. His Worthy - eight mighty, mystically empowered warriors - spread fear in his name. With the planet seized by panic and chaos erupting worldwide, one of Tony Stark's oldest, most dangerous enemies stands transformed as one of the Worthy, and an unsuspecting Paris will pay the ultimate price. Now, Iron Man must fight a war on two fronts: one against the hammer-wielding Grey Gargoyle, and another against the soul-numbing dependency that has cost him so much.<br><br> <strong>COLLECTING:</strong> INVINCIBLE IRON MAN 504-509, FEAR ITSELF 7.3: IRON MAN 1<br><br></p><p>Matt Fraction started creating comics with the smaller publishers, like AiT/Planet Lar and IDW Publishing. He is also known for his work on <i>The Five Fists of Science</i> and <i>Casanova</i>, as well as a number of series for Marvel Comics. Fraction is currently working on Marvel's <i>Uncanny X-Men</i>, <i>Thor</i> and <i>Invincible Iron Man</i>, the latter of which led to his consulting work on the set of the film <i>Iron Man 2.</i><br><br>Salvador Larroca worked as a cartographer for several for several years, after which he began working as a comic artist.

It was not until after his run on <i>Ghost Rider</i>, that Larroca would gain the exposure needed to become known as one of the most prominent comic book artists in The United States.</p><h2>Figure Drawing (Dover Art Instruction)</h2><p>While there are any number of anatomy texts and handbooks for artists, this is one of the few available studies that approach the art of figure drawing from the point of view of the draftsman. Though it does provide a fund of information on all important anatomical features and functions, the book stresses how the figure-sketcher should handle his subject, how he should actually put down surface lines and prominences on paper. It is an immensely practical guide for the student. <br>The text covers all aspects of drawing the human form. An important introductory section deals with methods of drawing and the proper proportioning of the body. Then the author treats the various parts of the body in full detail: head and neck (over 100 pages on facial features, etc.), the trunk (chest, abdomen, vertebral column, breast, pelvis, shoulders, etc.) and the upper and lower limbs and digits. A final discussion takes up the topic of drapery, the main points of support on the body, and various styles of representing the folds and forms of garments. <br>Three hundred seventy-seven figures, mostly sketches by the author, but including some examples from classical times and famous artists, illustrate the text. These figures show undraped men and women of all ages and types in various positions and movements and from all angles (full front view, profile, three-quarter view, rear view, etc.) so that the coverage is as thorough as possible for the student. Other drawings show and identify muscles and elements of the skeletal system and indicate their&nbsp;relation to surface contours. <br>A clear and readable account with many helpful suggestions on sketching technique, the book offers a nontechnical, inexpensive home-study course or supplementary text for the beginning artist. Those art students who derive little or no benefit from anatomy courses would do well to study this volume. <br>Unabridged, unaltered republication of original edition.</p><p></p><h2>Servants&#39; Stories: Life Below Stairs in their Own Words 1800-1950</h2><p>Step into the world of domestic service and discover what life was really like for these unsung heroines (and heroes) of society.

She helps her big sister, Elise, practice and hangs around to watch Elise's class go through their jetes and plies . Best of all, Tanya likes to create her own dances either alone or in a pas de deux with her teddy (a ballerina bear, naturally). She does a Swan Lake which is beyond Petipa's dreams. "You have two dancers in your family," her grandmother tells her mother after a family recital. Her mother does not forget, and sees to it that Tanya starts ballet class as soon as she is old enough. This is a charming family story, showing strong and loving relationships all around. Tanya is an engaging little heroine who does not let her size undermine her determination to have her heart's desire. Ichikawa's illustrations are especially attractive, leaning heavily on muted colors with splashes of black, red, and brown. All this is placed in a pleasing format, creating a ballet story with wide appeal. --Kay McPherson, Central Atlanta-Fulton Public Library<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Cambridge Apostles: A History of Cambridge University&#39;s Elite Intellectual Secret Society</h2><p>This is the story of the Apostles - Cambridge University's elite intellectual secret society - from its modest beginning in the 1820s to the revelation in recent decades that two of the most notorious "moles" for the Soviet secret service - Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt - were Apostles.<br></p><p>Founded in 1820, the Cambridge Conversazione Society has become better known as "The Apostles" from the fact that its 12 founder-members were evangelical clergymen. Although it became a secret organization and some of its adherents "sought out drugs as devotedly as the undergraduates of the 1960s," the society later was dominated by Lytton Strachey, John Maynard Keynes and such other advocates of "the higher sodomy" as the traitors Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt. Among the more famous members whose careers and foibles are discussed in this gossipy history are Tennyson, Bertrand Russell, E. M. Forster, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Jonathan Miller and Michael Straight.

His instincts on red alert and adrenaline in overdrive, Stone grabs the girl and runs--with anonymous assassins in hot pursuit. But whom do they wish to silence: Stone, the innocent child, or both? <br><br>During a heart-pounding chase that takes the resourceful, sometimes ruthless seasoned pro and his frightened young charge from Washington to Florida, and across the Atlantic to England, Stone begins to piece together a shocking global conspiracy. Thrust into a lethal game of cat-and-mouse, Stone is certain of two things: He and Kelly are on their own. No one can be trusted. And his darkest fears about the shadowy link between politics, money, and terrorism are about to be realized.<br><br>Combining relentless action, daring escapes, and breathless plotting with chillingly authentic operational detail rarely seen in thrillers, Remote Control is a novel so real and so suspenseful it sets a new standard for the genre.</p><p>Don't expect to see Andy McNab's photograph on the cover of his first thriller, <i>Remote Control</i>--the former British Special Air Service agent says both the Colombian drug cartel and the Provisional IRA still have contracts out on him. His two nonfiction books, <i>Bravo Two Zero</i> and <i>Immediate Action</i>, give more detail about his prolific past.<p> <i>Remote Control</i> is the fictional story of an SAS agent named Nick Stone, who is on the case of two Irish terrorists. He follows them across the Atlantic to Washington, D.C., but is suddenly ordered back home on the next available flight. His old mate Kevin Brown, now with the Drug Enforcement Agency, lives near the airport, so Nick decides to drop in. He finds a slaughterhouse: Kev, his wife, and youngest daughter have been battered to death, but daughter Kelly has survived in a special hideout. Prying information from the shocked child, Nick links the killers to either the CIA, the DEA, or his own organization--which means that he and Kelly are virtually on their own. As Nick trundles the spunky youngster from one seedy motel to another, stuffs her with junk food, and teaches her the rudiments of spy craft, he also begins to piece together a picture of why Kevin and his family were killed. There is a connection between a terrorist bomb scare in Gibraltar in 1988, the Colombian drug cartel, and high-level intelligence-agency skullduggery. McNab keeps dropping those shiny nuggets of believability along the trail and winds up holding our attention until the predictable but satisfying end. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>"PULSE-RACING."<br>--Mail on Sunday<p>"BRISTLES WITH AUTHENTICITY."<br>--The Times (London)</p><p>"GRITTY."<br>--The Scotsman</p><p>"SCARY."<br>--Independent on Sunday (London)</p><p>"CUNNING."<br>--Daily Telegraph</p></p><h2>The Book of Lamentations</h2><p>In the Mexican state of Chiapas in the 1930s, poverty, illiteracy, and rage contribute to an uprising among the descendants of the Mayan Indians</p><p>Thirty years before the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas brought this little-known corner of Mexico to the world's notice, Mexican author Rosario Castellanos created a similar rebellion in her 1962 novel <b>The Book of Lamentations</b>. Castellanos has framed her story, which is set in the 1930s, around an actual 1860s uprising of Maya Indians against the Chiapan white ruling class. History and fiction meld seamlessly, mainly because conditions in the Chiapas Castellanos knew as a child hadn't changed much in the intervening 70 years; as late as the 1920s, impoverished Indians still served as mules, carrying white landowners strapped to their backs. <p> The book's title is apt; Castellanos casts an unflinching eye on the effects of oppression, ignorance, and misery. The central characters, motivated variously by desperation, superstition, or ambition, may not be admirable, but they are all too human. In the end, a rebellion culminating in the grisly crucifixion of a child is doomed to failure. Although <b>The Book of Lamentations</b> is not a pleasant book, in an age where history seems increasingly to be repeating itself in Asia, in the Balkans, in Mexico, and elsewhere, it is a deeply instructive one.</p><b>Rosario Castellanos</b>&nbsp;(1925-74) was born&nbsp;Mexico City and spent much of her childhood in Comit�n, in Mayan southern Mexico. After traveling to Europe and to the United States for advanced study in aesthetics, she returned to the province of Chiapas to work with Indian theater groups and the Indigenous Institute of San Crist�bal. Much of her work, even throughout her involvement with the literary group "The Generation of the '50s," tried to traverse the distance between the pre-Columbian and the European cultural traditions of Mexico. While serving as Mexican ambassador to Israel, Castellanos died in a freak household accident in Tel Aviv. In an irony she might have enjoyed, she was buried in the rotunda of Illustrious Men, in Mexico City.</p><h2>Antarctic Fishes</h2><p><p>The break-up of the supercontinent of Gondwana and the formation of the Southern Ocean resulted in the creation of some of the strangest species imaginable&#x2015;the Antarctic fish fauna. The waters surrounding the southern continent are home to an enormous number of fish species rarely seen by anyone outside the worlds of Antarctic research and commercial fisheries. This book describes the physical characteristics, habits, and distribution of fifty-four species of these fascinating fish.

Surfers, students, deadheads and druggies; Joan Baez, Dean Martin, Howard Hughes and John Wayne - all emerge from Didion&#39;s gaze just that little bit weirder, that little bit more American. Joan Didion has also written &#34;Sentimental Journeys&#34; and &#34;The White Album&#34;.</p><p>Upon its publication in 1968, Slouching Towards Bethlehem confirmed Joan Didion as one of the most prominent writers on the literary scene. Her unblinking vision and deadpan tone have influenced subsequent generations of reporters and essayists, changing our expectations of style, voice, and the artistic possibilities of nonfiction. <br>"In her portraits of people," "The New York Times Book Review wrote, "Didion is not out to expose but to understand, and she shows us actors and millionaires, doomed brides and naive acid-trippers, left-wing ideologues and snobs of the Hawaiian aristocracy in a way that makes them neither villainous nor glamorous, but alive and botched and often mournfully beautiful. . . . A rare display of some of the best prose written today in this country." <br>In essay after essay, Didion captures the dislocation of the 1960s, the disorientation of a country shredding itself apart with social change. Her essays not only describe the subject at hand--the murderous housewife, the little girl trailing the rock group, the millionaire bunkered in his mansion--but also offer a broader vision of America, one that is both terrifying and tender, ominous and uniquely her own. <br>Joyce Carol Oates has written, "Joan Didion is one of the very few writers of our time who approaches her terrible subject with absolute seriousness, with fear and humility and awe. Her powerful irony is often sorrowful rather than clever. . . . She has been an articulate witness to the most stubborn and intractable truths of our time, a memorable voice, partly eulogistic, partly despairing; always in control.""A slant vision that is arresting and unique . . . Didion might be an observer from another planet--one so edgy and alert that she ends up knowing more about our own world than we know ourselves."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Anne Tyler<br><br>"The story between the lines of Slouching Towards Bethlehem is surely not so much 'California' as it is [Didion's] ability to make us share her passionate sense of it."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Alfred Kazin<br></p><h2>To Be Young, Gifted and Black a Portrait of Lorranine Hansberry in Her Own Words by Nemiroff, Robert.

At a time when more people than ever before are enslaved somewhere on the planet, Aaron Cohen is a slave hunter -- working to find and free human beings from various forms of bondage. <br> <br> The flesh trade is the world's fastest-growing and most deadly illegal enterprise -- even more profitable and easier to hide than guns, drugs, and precious gems. Free from diplomatic restrictions and political agendas, Cohen is a unique asset to government agencies, think tanks, and anti-slavery organizations. He navigates the oppressive territory of pimps and drug lords, cloaked in the all-too-familiar world of substance abuse, oversized egos, and changing rules. Working alone and posing as a sex tourist, he slips into brothels, urged by madams to select from a lineup of women and girls as young as six. Sometimes he can save them from their captors, but more often than not, he must leave them behind, taking only the evidence he hopes will eventually lead to their rescue. <br> <br> Struggling to make ends meet on his own negligible salary, Cohen faces temptations few could resist and witnesses atrocities his friends and family cannot understand. And though many assignments over the years carry him away from his ailing father, his commitment to protect, assist, and empower human trafficking victims -- and to disrupt the patterns that lead to all forms of enslavement -- is unyielding. <br> <br> In a remarkable expos� of a sinister trade most of us will never experience first-hand, rocker-turned-antislavery activist Aaron Cohen reveals the fast-paced, timely, inspiring, and unforgettable story of a real life <i>Slave Hunter</i>.</p><p><b>Aaron Cohen</b> has been a&nbsp;teen water polo star, a member of Jane's Addiction, a recovering addict, spiritually re-awakened, a co-founder of the "Drop the Debt" campaign, and bestowed with the Prize for Humanity by the Immortal Chaplains Foundation for his dangerous, official undercover work rescuing human trafficking victims in Africa, the Middle East, South America, and southeast Asia.<br><br><b>Christine Buckley</b> wrote a profile on Aaron for<i> LA Weekly </i>titled "From Hunter to Hunted."

I'm following the commander and his men down an unlit back street. At this hour, the metal gates on the neighborhood's living room emporiums are all down. The relative quiet belies the not-soclandestine activities of the city's shadow world, which bursts into life after dark. I watch drunken men stagger away from makeshift street bars and roar off into the dark on throaty Chinese motorbikes. Children in dirty T-shirts and plastic sandals are splashing in swampy puddles created by a combination of daily rain and ruts deep enough to lose sight of a rat, of which there are more than a few.</p><p>We pass a small night market, with a cluster of low red and blue plastic tables and stools where small groups of men have gathered to slurp soup and homemade rice moonshine. The vendors' candles flicker and cast a dim glow on some of the exotic delicacies on offer. Locusts roasted on tiny coal grills. Duck blood with fresh herbs. Deep-fried tarantulas.</p><p>Toward the back of this makeshift market, I spot a dozen or so dogs crammed into cages, ready and waiting for the hot pot. I can hear a few of the puppies whimpering in the darkness, see them chewing at their chains. I wonder if they slaughter them right here, too. No one else seems to notice. We enter our fourth karaoke bar of the night through a door so low I have to fold my six-foot-fiveinch frame almost in half to make it through.</p><p>The darkened room is long and narrow, with a U-shaped leather sectional facing a large-screen TV blaring karaoke in Khmer, the Cambodian language. A young Vietnamese woman in a short blue dress grabs my elbow and leads me to a spot in the middle of the couch. Other hostesses seat the commander and his men -- all in Royal Cambodian Armed Forces uniform -- on either side of me. These guys are the Cambodian elite, and I need their approval. Although I'm dressed up in a collared white shirt, I'm suddenly self-conscious about my unruly hair and dark jeans next to their pressed fatigues and linear haircuts.</p><p>The images of the dogs don't go away when I close my eyes for a second. I feel for the tiny bottle of green eucalyptus oil in my jacket, shake out a few drops, and slowly rub it into my temples, but it can't prevent the slideshow of canine slaughter scenarios flickering behind my closed eyelids. It's after midnight and there's a full glass of Johnnie Walker Black on the table in front of me, next to a stack of thick plastic binders bursting with photocopied lyrics in six different languages. The table is so low it barely hits my shins.</p><p>The rest of the men in the room, whose faces I can't make out in the dim light, are waiting for me to sing. One of them hands me a microphone.</p><p>"U.S.A. song," the man in the uniform insists, nudging me. I don't want to sing, not now, not here. I need to focus on the long and ugly night ahead, and it's hard to keep the mood light. But everyone is smiling, prodding me to go on. This is part of the game I've played for the last few years in a dozen other countries. Now I'll sing "Peace Frog" or "Sounds of Silence," and the commander will applaud, smile encouragingly, and pass me the dried squid as if to tell me not to worry. Life here is like this. Sing another karaoke number to take your mind off reality.<br></p><p><i>Blood in the streets it's up to my ankles</i><br></p><p>I'm the only one in the room who knows what I'm singing about -- the only one seemingly bothered by the room's crimson bulbs casting a bloody glow over our gathering. I've got to smile, to reassure these men that I can party with them, show them I am not shaken by any of what we've seen or are about to see. No one goes home until the commander says it's time.</p><p>As I continue to sing, I notice a young, pretty girl wearing too much lip gloss. She pours more whiskey over a big chunk of ice, picks up the glass with both hands, and offers it to me with a winning smile. I accept it with a nod, then put the glass down immediately and go for the beer instead, which seems more reasonable considering my physical condition. I never get enough time in one place to recover from the jet lag. I haven't fully unpacked my suitcase for a long time now.</p><p>The girl with the lip gloss's name is Mai and her English is pretty good. She has been translating for Commander Nam, along with Anh, who's sitting on Nam's other side, feeding him spicy dried peas.<br></p><p><i>Bloody red sun of phantastic L.A....</i><br></p><p>Only I'm not Jim Morrison in fantastic seventies L.A. I haven't been home for two weeks now, and haven't had a good night's sleep in even longer.</p><p>The commander's men are clapping and humming along to the guitar licks, and I almost start to enjoy myself. But after the familiar Doors lyrics flow out of my mouth, the words of a Cambodian song I heard last night come back to torment my addled mind:<br></p><p><i>Bright red blood splatters the cities and plains And over the plain of Kampuchea, our motherland. The blood of good workers and peasants...Blood spills out into great indignation...Blood that frees us from slavery.</i><br></p><p>They are part of the national anthem the Khmer Rouge adopted when they took power in 1975, turning the country's clock back to "Year <b>Z</b>ero" and unleashing four years of genocidal terror on their people. Yesterday I watched a bootleg copy of a new documentary on the Khmer Rouge's tragic reign that brought all the horror back to the forefront.</p><p>Shaken by the resurgence of the film's images and sound, I forfeit the microphone to the soldier next to me, who passes it directly to Commander Nam. He's already programmed in the next song, a thumping Thai love anthem that has the girls shimmying in their seats.</p><p>"Cheers!" Nam turns to me, holding up an Angkor beer with a muscular arm and waiting for me to clink my bottle with his. The aged whiskey's presence on the table indicates Nam's high status, as do the abundant tiny plates of salty snacks and spicy dipping sauces. There is an assault rifle leaning up against the sofa next to a squareshouldered bodyguard. The inevitable strains of what seems to be every Southeast Asian man's favorite American song echo from the huge TV speakers:<br></p><p><i>On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair...</i><br></p><p>It's my turn again, and I sing the verses by heart without evenlooking at the screen, stopping every so often to answer Nam'spointed questions about my past. He listens intently as Mai translatesthe encapsulated version: my years at the U.S. Air Force Academy,slave retrievals in Sudan, the work with human traffickingvictims. I intentionally leave out the part about Jane's Addiction -- the proverbial sex, drugs, and rock and roll.<br></p><p><i>You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave...</i><br></p><p>My opportunity comes during the long guitar solo.</p><p>"Commander, I'm going to Siem Reap to retrieve slave girls," I ay. "I'd like your authorization, sir, and a unit to back me up."</p><p>I can't do this kind of work alone or extrajudicially. In order to escape jail, kidnapping charges, or mafia bullets, I have to put together my own paramilitary team before leaving Phnom Penh. No matter how anarchic it seems to the outside observer, Cambodia still has its own rules -- ones that have to be learned and followed. I can't just crash into a brothel on a white horse and break out some girls.</p><p>The Cambodian equivalent of a written warrant is an official authorization from within the ranks of the police or the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, the select corps of men with the access I need. Which is why I have been introduced to Commander Nam.</p><p>Nam just nods and makes "Mmm" noises while flipping through the plastic binder, making his next selection. I ask him about a raid my contacts at the American Embassy have told me about in the infamous brothel town of Svay Pak, known to locals as K11 -- named after its location eleven kilometers from the city center. I've heard there were hundreds of young children enslaved there.</p><p>After a long, uneasy silence, Nam makes eye contact with me. Yes, he says, his military unit participated in that bust, which was successful in that most of the brothels there have been forced to temporarily shut their doors. But the traffickers simply found a new location, known as Two o'Clock, which he calls "worse than K11." There's not a lot he can do about it.</p><p>One of my friends in the charity world has recommended Nam, so I'm sure he's one of the good guys. Unfortunately, it seems there are plenty of men wearing the same uniform who are not on our side.</p><p>Nam watches me consider this, then taps my knee and says in English, "Don't worry, don't worry, my friend, my friend."</p><p>Anh is translating now. "Mr. Nam say you want his men help you, you must to do some thing for him before."</p><p>"Of course," I say.</p><p>"Okay. You get for him girls on video, say what bad things happen, names of who big boss, pictures where the rooms, what look like, where mamasan, where big boss sleeping."</p><p>"I can do that," I say. I can start to feel the adrenaline flowing. We're going to do this.</p><p>Nam reaches into his pocket, pulls out a silver pen, and writes down a phone number on a paper napkin. "You call Mr. Heng," he says, putting his index and pinkie to his ear as though talking on the phone. Mai and Anh beam at the commander's successful utterance of a complete English sentence. Anh hand-feeds him a morsel of seaweed while Mai pours us both a celebratory glass of whiskey. Both girls take sips from their tall glasses of orang...</p></p><h2>Retreat to Victory?: Confederate Strategy Reconsidered (The American Crisis Series: Books on the Civil War Era)</h2><p>Did Confederate armies attack too often for their own good? Was the relentless, sometimes costly effort to preserve territory a blunder? Why great battles in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and Tennessee rather than well-laid ambushes in Alabama's sandhills or the pine forests of the Carolinas? These questions about Confederate strategy have dogged historians since Appomattox. Many have come to believe that the South might have won the Civil War if it had only avoided head-on battles, conducted an aggressive guerrilla campaign, and maneuvered across wide swaths of territory to exhaust the Union's willingness to continue the war. <i>Retreat to Victory? Confederate Strategy Reconsidered</i> challenges this widely held theory. Robert G. Tanner argues that deep retreats and battle avoidance (the strategy of maneuver rather than combat) were not available to Southern leaders in planning their wartime strategy. The South fought as it did for valid reasons, according to Tanner, and this book examines these reasons in detail, including the South's need to protect its slave-based economy, to establish a state's rights-oriented government, and to win independence from the Union. Tanner uses Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz's classic <i>On War</i> as a means for evaluating Confederate actions. <i>On War</i> provides a single measure for testing claims that the South could have prevailed by avoiding battles and forcing the Union to hold large tracts of land.<br><br> Provocative and carefully researched, <i>Retreat to Victory</i> offers a fresh perspective on Confederate strategy and makes an important contribution to the field that no serious student of American history will want to miss.</p><p><b>Robert G.

Ever since the publication of his first management book in 1946, <i>Concept of the Corporation</i>, which was based on his study of General Motors, Drucker has devoted his career to shaping and developing the art of professional management. In fact, <i>Concept of the Corporation</i> is considered to be the first book on management, period. <p><i>On the Profession of Management</i> is a compilation of Drucker's work that has appeared in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i> over the last 30 years. Review editor Nan Stone has organized 13 articles into two sections. The first, "The Manager's Responsibilities," focuses on the work of management, making decisions, and practicing innovation. The second section, "The Executive's World," looks at how managers should manage in a knowledge-based economy--indeed Drucker was one of the first to consider the implications of knowledge economies. </p><p>If you think Drucker has lost anything over the years, the book's insightful and provocative preface, "The Future That Has Already Happened," will surely change your mind. <i>On the Profession of Management</i> is an insightful and informative read, a tribute to one of the finest minds of the 20th century.</p>"Peter Drucker, whose prolific writings and profound insights date back to the 1930s with his prescient treatise on the origins of totalitarianism, stands as one of the most significant and consistent contributors to the functioning of our modern world. Effective management dispersed throughout society makes a free world possible and is the only workable alternative to a resurgence of tyranny or dictatorship, and no one has done more to increase widespread management effectiveness than Peter Drucker. This book provides a wonderful selection of his contributions." --Jim Collins, Co-author of <i>Built to Last</i> <p>"Peter Drucker combines the clarity of a journalist, the focus of an economist, and the scope of a historian with the heart of a grandfather. His contribution to society can be glimpsed in the useful, insightful chapters of this book. Buy it, read it, and use it to make your organization the firm of the future." --Frances Hesselbein, President and CEO of The Drucker Foundation</p></p><h2>The Freds at Barneys New York Cookbook</h2><p><b>The definitive cookbook by the celebrated chef and managing director of Freds at Barneys New York, one of the nation's most fashionable restaurants.</b><br><br> Barneys New York, with its flagship store on Madison Avenue, is a world-famous cutting-edge fashion destination, and a true New York phenomenon.

He was an ambitious upland rat from Brooklyn, New York.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hope shuddered. &#x201c;But he was nasty!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He was misguided,&#x201d; Hopper corrected, but this was being generous. The truth was that as emperor, Titus had made a host of extremely poor choices, and countless innocent rodents had suffered because of his politics. It was also true that Titus had taken a forgotten subway platform deep beneath the borough of Brooklyn and transformed it into the spectacular city that lay before them now. But to maintain this prosperity, he had been forced to spend most of his reign sacrificing unsuspecting tunnel wanderers to the evil cat Queen Felina. Titus justified his own evil as being necessary to buy peace for Atlantia.<br> <br>In the end, he paid a much greater price.<br> <br>But Hopper did not like to discuss such gruesome details with his little friend. Instead he told her a far more palatable version of the story.<br> <br>&#x201c;Long ago, Titus happened upon this abandoned platform and chose it as the site on which to build his dazzling city. Under Titus&#x2019;s leadership, Atlantia bloomed into a great civilization.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But my grandfather was hiding a dark secret,&#x201d; Hope cried, knowing the story by heart.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes he was.&#x201d; Hopper gave her a solemn nod. &#x201c;A secret that brought a great deal of pain to many . . . including himself. But thanks to your mother and father . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you! The Chosen One!&#x201d;<br> <br>Hopper blushed slightly. &#x201c;Right . . . thanks to all of us, and the rebels and the refugees, Titus was overthrown, and then, not long after, Felina, too, was defeated, putting an end to the brutality and the tyranny.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But in the aftermath of battle Atlantia fell to ruins,&#x201d; Hope gushed, her eyes brimming with intelligence and excitement. &#x201c;Now you and the emperor and empress&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Hopper grinned. &#x201c;Otherwise known as your mommy and daddy. You know they do not wish to be called by such titles anymore, now that Atlantia&#x2019;s government is shifting away from a monarchy to something more democratic and fair.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hope rolled her eyes and pouted. &#x201c;I know. I also know that that means they don&#x2019;t want me to wear beautiful crowns and gowns and jewels, like my grandmamma, the empress Conselyea, did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In the scheme of things, crowns and gowns don&#x2019;t count for much,&#x201d; Hopper reminded her.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I like being a princess.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, little one, but your parents would much rather you liked being a good and wise leader instead.&#x201d; Hopper patted her between the ears. &#x201c;They are determined to see Atlantia rise again, so it can welcome all rodents and offer them protection within its walls. And without any dark secrets this time. Come along, now.&#x201d;<br> <br>As they started toward the palace, Hopper turned his attention back to the bustle of the city below. There he saw progress. Mice working beside rats working beside squirrels working beside chipmunks. Atlantia was on its way to once again becoming the magnificent place it had been the first time he&#x2019;d seen it. After many long months of thrilling innovation and intensive labor, the underground urban masterpiece was nearly complete; the city was thriving again.<br> <br>But it was more than just structural and commercial changes that Emperor Zucker and Empress Firren were striving for. They had an entirely new vision of the way Atlantia should be governed, and to this end, their empire was in the midst of great political improvements as well.<br> <br>Citizens could now vote on civic decisions, and express their ideas at public hearings. Zucker had gotten the idea from a book in Titus&#x2019;s library. He called it a &#x201c;republic,&#x201d; and together he and Firren were determined to make it a reality for Atlantia.<br> <br>But they understood that even positive change took time, and they respected the fact that their subjects needed to get used to the idea.<br> <br>So they stopped wearing their opulent jewels and elegant clothing. Zucker wore the same workaday attire his subjects did (which he found far more comfortable than his royal garb), and Firren always donned her beloved Rangers tunic. They requested that the Atlantians call them by name, not title.<br> <br>Even still, the rodents insisted on bowing and curtsying to them and calling them His and Her Highness. The habit, it seemed, was difficult to break.<br> <br>It seemed strange to Hopper that the rodents needed to be convinced of something that was in their own best interests, but there it was. He wondered: Did they believe that outward finery and glitz represented ability and competence? That was exactly the kind of superficiality Titus had relied upon to justify his authority. And look how that turned out!<br> <br>In truth, when it came to governing, Hopper knew that it was what was inside a rodent that counted. The character, not the crown, was what defined a ruler.<br> <br>Sadly, little Hope did not yet understand this particular truth, but Hopper wasn&#x2019;t worried. She was still very young and she had many things to learn. At the moment, his darling godchild might be easily dazzled by her empress grandmamma&#x2019;s old tiaras and dresses (which she&#x2019;d determinedly dug out of the palace basement and claimed for her own), but he truly believed she&#x2019;d come to understand the value of invisible things like honesty, loyalty, and integrity. He was confident that she and her four littermates would one day step up to take part in the wonderful new government their parents were working so hard to set in motion.<br> <br>This gave Hopper great joy indeed.<br> <br>But mingled with his joy was the faintest prickle of sadness. It brought to mind his own littermates . . . his brother and sister. The last time he&#x2019;d stood upon this ledge, he&#x2019;d had no idea what his own future held and he&#x2019;d been desperate to know what had become of Pinkie and Pup.<br> <br>He knew well enough where Pinkie was now&#x2014;safe behind the gray wall of their ancestral village, ruling the Mus citizens with her newfound wisdom and benevolence. To Hopper&#x2019;s great relief, Pinkie had undergone a change of heart after discovering that their father, the legendary rebel Dodger, was still alive. She was still given to grumbling and bossiness, but she was no longer angry or unkind. Dodger split his time between assisting Pinkie in ruling the Mus, and advising Zucker here in Atlantia. Hopper was thrilled about Pinkie&#x2019;s new outlook.<br> <br>But Pup. Pup was another story entirely.<br> <br>Where in these vast tunnels their diminutive sibling had taken himself off to still remained a mystery. And what Pup might be up to was anybody&#x2019;s guess.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uncle Hopper! Look!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it, Hope?&#x201d; Hopper asked, shaking off his dark thoughts. &#x201c;What do you see?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Over there!&#x201d; Hope leaned so far toward the rim of the ledge that Hopper had to lunge forward to grasp the hood of her tiny pink cloak (a gift from Pinkie, of course). &#x201c;In the market square! That chipmunk is selling whirligigs! Can I please have a whirligig? I can, can&#x2019;t I? I can have anything I want&#x2014;after all, I am a crown princess of Atlantia!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hope,&#x201d; said Hopper, gently but firmly, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s wrong to demand things just because you happened to be born to Zucker and Firren. You should focus on earning the things you want.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hope gave him a pout. &#x201c;But I didn&#x2019;t demand. I asked politely.&#x201d; She gave a heavy sigh. &#x201c;So . . . no whirligig, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hopper chuckled. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say that. I only meant that if you do get one, it won&#x2019;t be because you are entitled to it as a princess. It will be because your parents and I like to see you happy and because you&#x2019;ve earned it. But for now the whirligig will have to wait. You know you&#x2019;re expected in the schoolroom.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hope let out a little snort. &#x201c;Do I have to go? The tutor smells funny and my brothers and sisters pick on me. And there&#x2019;s no one else to play with.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hopper smiled. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that, but you can take comfort in the fact that soon you&#x2019;ll all be enrolled in the public school,&#x201d; he promised. &#x201c;Your mama is determined to see that happen sooner than later. It&#x2019;s just a matter of getting it built.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it can&#x2019;t happen soon enough for me!&#x201d; she huffed. &#x201c;My siblings all think they&#x2019;re so smart!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just as smart as they are.&#x201d;<br> <br>She smiled at the compliment, then frowned again. &#x201c;Not as smart as Brighton is. She&#x2019;s a genius. They call her Bright-one. Of course, she never has any fun.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hopper laughed. &#x201c;She is the serious one of the litter, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Hope agreed. &#x201c;And Verrazano is the great leader and talented swordsman. Fiske is the clown but also a philosopher, and Go-go is the one who all the little boy rats of the city fawn over and make goofy eyes at.&#x201d; She frowned. &#x201c;Princess Gowanus, the royal heartbreaker.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go-go has her good points,&#x201d; Hopper said, biting back another chuckle. &#x201c;You all do. Which is why Zucker and Firren and all the rest of us are so proud of each and every one of you. You&#x2019;re a wonderful little bunch of future upstanding politicians.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I prefer princes and princesses,&#x201d; Hope teased.<br> <br>&#x201c;Royal heirs,&#x201d; said Hopper, compromising by using the commonly accepted term for referring to Firren and Zucker&#x2019;s offspring. &#x201c;Will you settle for that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess,&#x201d; said Hope, placing her paw in Hopper&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Hopper recalled the night he&#x2019;d sat down with Firren and Zucker to discuss recasting the public&#x2019;s impression of their babies by coming up with a better, more down-to-earth term than the &#x201c;royal heirs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can call them the Patriot Pups,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d suggested. &#x201c;That has a nice ring to it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not bad,&#x201d; Zucker had allowed. &#x201c;But how about the Children of Democracy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s still a bit lofty,&#x201d; Firren had observed with a grin. She&#x2019;d thought for a moment, then clapped her hands. &#x201c;We can continue to refer to them as royal heirs, as long as we&#x2019;re very clear about the fact that what they are heir to is responsibility and purpose, and not riches and unqualified adoration.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zucker had smiled, his eyes twinkling. &#x201c;I like it,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d pronounced. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be the heirs to our best intentions and our most worthy efforts.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hopper had thought that was the perfect way to look at it, but in truth he would have loved the little rats no matter what anyone called them.<br> <br>Now Hope was tugging at the sleeve of his tunic, giving him her most glowing smile. &#x201c;Of all us royal heirs, I&#x2019;m your favorite, aren&#x2019;t I, Uncle Hopper?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hopper beamed at her. It was true that Hope held a special place in her godfather&#x2019;s heart. And with very good reason:<br> <br>When the royal litter had arrived, Hopper and Pinkie had both been there to provide Zucker, the nervous first-time father, some much-needed support and distraction. Marcy, back in the palace on one of her rare visits, had skillfully assisted the midwife, Maimonides, who&#x2019;d come all the way from the Mus village to lend her experience and expertise. When Mamie, as the midwife was called, handed Zucker his firstborn&#x2014;a daughter&#x2014;he&#x2019;d kissed the squirming infant on her forehead and promptly named her Gowanus.<br> <br>Marcy gave the second pup, a boy, to Pinkie to hold.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll call him Verrazano,&#x201d; Zucker decreed. &#x201c;Raz for short.&#x201d;<br> <br>Little Raz&#x2019;s first royal act was to spit up all over Pinkie&#x2019;s golden cape. Hopper took some brotherly pleasure in seeing that.<br> <br>Two more pups arrived, mewling and cooing&#x2014;twins, one male, one female. They were christened Fiske and Brighton, and handed to Dodger to snuggle. At last the fifth and final royal rat-ling entered the world. Yet another precious baby girl.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hope,&#x201d; Firren whispered, exhausted but happy. &#x201c;Her name is Hope. After your mother, Hopper.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hopper had been too choked up to speak at first, so touched was he by such a tribute. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a lovely name,&#x201d; he whispered at last, when Marcy placed the babe in his arms. The rush of love he&#x2019;d felt was nearly indescribable. Such innocence, he thought, gazing down at her scrunched-up little face. Such possibility and promise.<br> <br>But it was immediately clear that Princess Hope was by far the smallest of Firren&#x2019;s litter&#x2014;the runt, as Pinkie might have said in the old days. It was also evident that the newborn princess was in great distress. She struggled to catch her breath, writhing and squirming, as though the act of living was simply beyond her capability.<br> <br>Marcy had given Hopper a somber look. &#x201c;Keep her warm,&#x201d; she advised softly. &#x201c;And think good thoughts.&#x201d;<br> <br>While the other four robust heirs had snuggled up to their empress mother in peaceful slumber, poor little Hope wheezed and gasped and shuddered, fighting for her life.<br> <br>As the night wore on, Hope&#x2019;s condition worsened. Zucker was inconsolable, sick with worry. For hours he paced the palace floor, stomping his paws in anger, crying out in frustration and sending off muttered wishes to La Rocha (something Zucker rarely did) that his infant daughter might be spared.<br> <br>Hopper saw in Hope&#x2019;s pale little features how much she resembled her father, the friend and comrade he loved so dearly; he simply could not stand the thought of what it would do to Zucker and Firren if they lost this precious bundle. So the Chosen One had held the shivering pup while murmuring words of encouragement and hope, humming to her gently and keeping her warm all through that endless night.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what else to do,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said to Marcy, his voice trembling.<br> <br>Marcy had smiled. &#x201c;Tell her a story. Tell her your story. I can&#x2019;t imagine a better pep talk.&#x201d;<br> <br>So Hopper did.

He lives in Tampa, FL. </p>In his seventh screwball mystery, Dorsey (<i>Cadillac Beach</i>; <i>Orange Crush</i>) serves up his usual cocktail of tropical mayhem and humor, though the mix is a little slushy this time around. Serge Storms, the nutty serial killer from Dorsey's previous novels, has gotten it into his head to search for Mrs. Right. His quest takes him to the underbelly of the Florida Keys, where he finds unlikely true love the minute he spots mousy librarian Molly. But even marriage can't tame Dorsey's hyperactive antihero, whose extracurricular activities of murder and cult organizing eventually lead to a clash with an Enron-like CEO eager to rebuild the community, and with a mysterious drug lord who is intent on destroying it. Muddying the waters are Coleman, an annoying junkie with the mentality of a fourth grader; Gus DeLand, a deputy whose ex-girlfriend's revelations about his sex life have the whole town laughing; and Anna Sebring, a woman out to avenge her brother's death. A few ingenious plot points entertain, but never credibly intersect; the hectic action fails to add up to a smooth-flowing story. The colorful Keys get Dorsey's trademark treatment, but even irrepressible zaniness isn't enough to keep this leaky vessel afloat. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Culture, it was understood, makes the man or woman. More recently, this has been seen as too conservative a credo and some anthropologists have shifted to a study of how people overcome culture. This shift in emphasis from acculturation to empowerment is reflected in this collection of essays on feminism written over a 20-year time span. The earliest essay details the cultural subordination of women. The later essays are accounts of women bucking male domination, including a fascinating account of liberated Western women climbing in the Himalayas. Its complex portrait of sexual liaisons with local porters, of demands for female porters, and the effect on the local culture, creates an apt symbol of women seeking power and climbing a mountain.Sherry B. Ortner is professor of anthropology at Columbia University. Her books include <i>High Religion: A Cultural and Political History of Sherpa Buddhism</i> and <i>Culture/Power/History: A Reader in Contemporary Social Theory</i> (coedited with Nicholas B. Dirks and Geoff Eley). She received a MacArthur Award in 1990 for her work in anthropology.</p><h2>Clement Greenberg: A Life</h2><p>The first biography of America&#39;s most influential art critic follows his rise to the height of New York City&#39;s art world, where he shepherded the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and others to worldwide acceptance</p><p>Clement Greenberg was born in the Bronx in 1909, the child of Jewish immigrants from Polish Lithuania. He attended Syracuse University, spent three years sleeping late, reading, and frequenting museums, and then toured the country as a traveling salesman for a necktie business owned by his father. By 1935 he was back in New York working at a routine civil service job. One could hardly have predicted that from these inauspicious beginnings would emerge one of the century&#39;s premier cultural critics. In 1939 he wrote &#34;Avant-Garde and Kitsch&#34;, the landmark essay that catapulted him from anonymity to the center of a stellar group of intellectuals known as the Partisan Review crowd - Saul Bellow, Irving Howe, Meyer Schapiro, and Lionel Trilling, among others. The subject of Greenberg&#39;s essay was modern society examined through popular culture and painterly abstraction. It was his uncanny response to the form abstraction was going to take in advanced American painting that placed him - with no formal training in art history - at the apex of the art world for the next fifty years. Greenberg&#39;s independent opinions and combative style soon made him enemies. Greenberg criticized the taste of the Museum of Modern Art, while he sang the praises of artists such as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, and David Smith when few in the art world took them seriously. By the end of the forties, when his ideas began appearing in Life, Time, and Newsweek, the establishment was compelled to react. Florence Rubenfeld traces the rise and fall of this impassioned and provocative critic, telling his story, in part, through his words and the words of the dazzling array of personalities who surroundedhim. She provides a new assessment of his profound contribution to art criticism, insights into his influences and identity, and an engaging social history of an infamous postwar milieu, peopled by brilliant intellectuals and ground-breaking artists. Clement Greenberg: A Life is an authoritative account of a remarkable man and the vibrant New York art world he helped to define.Florence Rubenfeld contributes to various art journals and was the East Coast editor for the <i>New Art Examiner</i> for several years. She has lectured on art at the Smithsonian and lives in Washington, D.C.</p><h2>The Psychoanalysis of Children (The Writings of Melanie Klein, Vol. 2)</h2><p>This book is a classic in its subject and one which revolutionized child analysis. Melanie Klein had already proved, by the special technique she devised, that she was a pioneer in that branch of analysis. She made possible the extension of psychoanalysis to the field of early childhood, and in this way not only made the treatment of young children possible but also threw new light on psychological development in childhood and on the roots of adult neuroses and psychoses. <br><br>This volume describes both the theory and practice of her methods, and includes a preface, written for the third edition, in which she outlines the development of her thinking in relation to certain essential hypotheses. <br><br>This new edition, which contains a revised translation and a new index, has an explanatory note by the Editorial Board of the Melanie Klein Trust placing 'The Psycho-Analysis of Children' in the general compass of her work.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Serpent&#39;s Tooth Mystery (The Hardy Boys #93)</h2><p>Visiting the zoo to see the new Australian tiger snake, Frank and Joe discover the body of Dr. Harrod Michaels, a herpetologist, and learn that several poisonous snakes have been stolen</p><p></p><h2>The Cuisine of the Sun: Classic Recipes from Nice and Provence</h2><p>FRENCH PROVENCAL COOKING.</p><p></p><h2>The Gospel of Second Chances</h2><p>We see examples all around us-the politician who loses an election only to come back another year and win; businesses that struggle or fail before reinventing themselves; people with serious health challenges who receive a new lease on life; students who fall short in school and yet become Accomplished contributors to society; prodigal children who change their lives and begin again. At some time or another, we all need a second chance, particularly when we fumble and falter and make mistakes. The Gospel of Second Chances looks at what makes second chances possible and what we can do to make a second chance successful. With a unique blend of inspiration, practicality, and gospel teaching, author Lloyd D. Newell uses scriptural and contemporary examples to convey the hopeful message that God wants us to believe in second chances-for ourselves and others. Lloyd D. Newell holds a PhD from Brigham Young University where he serves on the faculties of Religious Education and the school of Family Life. He is the author or coauthor of numerous books and has addressed audiences in forty-five states and more than a dozen countries through his seminars and speaking engagements.

He grew up in the Midwest and taught in a rural school in central Illinois for several years. He has been a reporter for public radio, a journalist, and the author of nonfiction books for young people. He and his wife live near Charlottesville, Virginia.Introduction<br>"As a reader I loathe Introductions," Nelle Harper Lee once wrote. But, with apologies to the subject, I must say that one is necessary for this book, the first ever about the woman who gave the world To Kill a Mockingbird, one of the most influential pieces of fiction produced in the United States. In a "Survey of Lifetime Reading Habits" conducted by the Book-of-the-Month Club in 1991, researchers found that To Kill a Mockingbird ranked second only to the Bible "as making a difference in people's lives." Forty-six years after its publication, the novel still draws almost a million readers annually. Maybe that is because its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal.<br>&nbsp;<br>This book aims to capture a life but is not a conventional biography, because--despite her novel's huge impact--Lee's writing life has been brief, and her personal life has been intensely private. She wrote only one book, her Pulitzer Prize-winning perennial bestseller, and then, after a brief moment in the spotlight, disappeared from the public eye. She has not sought fame, then or since, although around the time of To Kill a Mockingbird's publication she did grant interviews.<br>&nbsp;<br>Unlike her lifelong friend Truman Capote (perhaps even because of his example and experience), Harper Lee has never appeared comfortable in the limelight. In fact, not only does she not solicit attention, she also actively discourages it, refusing to speak in public and turning down all requests for interviews and all forms of cooperation with writers and reporters. In our era of relentless and often prurient self-exposure by some approval-hungry personalities, Lee prefers silence and self-respect. That is not to say she is furtively reclusive; though she enjoys her solitude, she is not some modern-day Emily Dickinson. She lives a normal life, replete with community activities, many related to her church. Lee is "like someone you'd meet in any small town," as Professor William Smart of Sweet Briar College, in Virginia, expressed it. And Smart has known Lee for forty years.<br>&nbsp;<br>Consequently, this book has been produced without Lee's help, although I have repeatedly solicited it. She has declined with vigor, even to the extent of refusing to respond to my attempts to check facts by mail. Despite her desire for privacy, I believe it is important to record Lee's story while there are still a few people alive who were part of it and can remember. I have tried to balance her desire for privacy with the desire of her millions of readers who have long hoped for a respectful, informative view of this rarely seen writer.<br>&nbsp;<br>This book is based on six hundred interviews and other sorts of communication with Harper Lee's friends, associates, and former classmates. It's also the product of four years of research into the papers of her friend Truman Capote, which include Lee's notes for his book In Cold Blood (for which she served as research assistant); the papers of Lee's literary agent; the archives of national and local libraries; and hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles. Until the mid-1960s, Lee was generous about granting interviews. I had to "put on my reporter's hat," as my late father, a journalist, liked to say, in order to trace this life, and I have tried to be as careful and as scrupulous as possible. I have sometimes made the decision to overlook topics that may have interested some, rather than to rely on psychologizing that I am not qualified to do or to risk producing errors that might find their way into future accounts of Lee.<br>&nbsp;<br>I want readers to be introduced to the author and get a sense of what makes her tick: the things that influenced her when she was growing up during the Depression in Monroeville, Alabama, for example; the reasons why classmates regarded her with awe; the traits of nonconformity and almost ferocious independence that distinguished her in college; the steps that led to her dropping out of law school and moving to New York to write; the sense of loyalty that drew her to Truman Capote's side when he was researching his "nonfiction novel," In Cold Blood; the sense of humor that sustained her while she was scrutinized by the media because of the success of To Kill a Mockingbird and the film based on it; and, finally, the reasons why she never wrote another novel.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I was researching this book, I tended to be asked the same questions by interested friends. The first was "Is Harper Lee still alive?" Yes. "Nail Har-puh," as her name is pronounced in her hometown, spends most of the year in Monroeville, and a few months in New York in the apartment she has maintained for the past forty-five years. Her eldest sister, Alice, ninety-four, who is one of the most highly regarded attorneys in Alabama, shares a house with Nelle in Monroeville. Residents are accustomed to seeing the two ladies puttering around the First United Methodist Church, where they have been members all their lives; at the country club where they enjoy the lunch buffet and the opportunity to see friends; and at various favorite diners around town. Nelle refuses to talk about To Kill a Mockingbird in social situations, and friends warn strangers not to bring it up. She has been known to leave the room if pestered about the novel.<br>&nbsp;<br>The second question I was asked was "Is she married?" The answer is no. That question was almost always followed by "Is she gay?" I do not necessarily make a connection between being unmarried and being gay. I cannot say if she is homosexual (she was friends with Capote and other openly gay people), heterosexual (she and her literary agent, Maurice Crain, were devoted to each other), or just not open to long-term romantic relationships. I do know, on the other hand, of her ability to charm others and cultivate friends--though she also has a temper, and as a child, had a reputation for bullying. I am not sure what labels Lee would apply to herself, except "woman," "Southerner," and perhaps "writer."<br>&nbsp;<br>The final question I was continually asked was "Why didn't she write another novel?" This was the big question I had asked myself in the first place, and which led to the adventure of writing this book. After reading it, I hope you will come away with at least some idea of why she never published another novel after To Kill a Mockingbird.<br>&nbsp;<br>Years ago, when I was an English teacher in a large high school near Chicago, I taught To Kill a Mockingbird to freshmen. That's a good time to be introduced to it, because students at that age are crossing the bridge from childhood to young adulthood, as the young characters in Lee's novel are. In-class discussions of the novel tend to be lively, and assigned essays are weighty with insights and opinions. It's a very rich text to teach.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you don't remember much about the novel, here's a summary:<br>&nbsp;<br>To Kill a Mockingbird is really two stories. One is a coming-of-age tale told from the point of view of Scout Finch, a girl of about nine, and her slightly older brother, Jem. The second story concerns their father, attorney Atticus Finch, who has been appointed to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, falsely accused of raping a white woman.<br>&nbsp;<br>There are also two broad themes: tolerance and justice. The first is treated through the children's interactions with Arthur "Boo" Radley, their mysterious and maligned neighbor; the second is illustrated by Atticus's courageous moral stance in defending Tom Robinson to the best of his ability, despite the racial prejudices of the town. Tying the themes together is a homespun piece of advice that Atticus gives Scout: "If you just learn a single trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view. . . . Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it." This appeal to recognize the humanity in everyone is practicable in normal day-to-day relations with people, even those we dislike, and, as Atticus powerfully demonstrates, in courtrooms where juries must sit in judgment of their fellow men and women.<br>&nbsp;<br>The plot of the coming-of-age story revolves around Boo Radley, who is rumored to be a kind of monster living in a shuttered house down the street from the Finches. Scout, Jem, and their next-door neighbor Dill Harris engage in pranks to make Boo show himself. Unexpectedly, however, Boo responds to their interest by reciprocating with small acts of kindness and consideration. They come to feel affectionate about their unseen friend.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Tom Robinson plot is fairly straightforward. As a black man, Tom doesn't have a ghost of chance of being acquitted of raping a white woman, and Atticus knows he will lose the case. Still, the attorney faces up to the challenge, even stepping between a lynch mob and his client, though racist taunts are directed at Atticus's children.<br>&nbsp;<br>The two plots intersect on a Halloween night not long after the trial is concluded. The drunken father of the girl Tom was accused of having raped ambushes the Finch children because Atticus exposed his ignorance and vices during the trial. He intends to kill the children, but they are saved by the angelic intervention of Boo Radley. Atticus is persuaded by the sheriff not to involve Radley in a homicide case (the children's attacker was killed during the struggle), because it would be cruel, he argues, to subject a pathologically shy man to a sensational trial that would, in any case, end in his acquittal. Atticus is unsure of the moral implications until Scout likens the choice to something her father once said: it's a sin to kill a mockingbird "because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy." Scout escorts Radley back to his home and safety.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the late 1990s, I left the teaching field to write biographies and histories for young adults. Historical and cultural figures such as Gandhi, Captain Cook, novelist Amy Tan, and filmmaker George Lucas were relatively easy to write about because of the wealth of information available about them. So, as a challenge, I started casting around for someone worthy of an adult book, but about whom not much was known. My thoughts returned to Harper Lee.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was astonishing how little appeared about her in ordinary reference books. Encyclopedias carried two or three paragraphs, and often the facts were contradictory. She either had a law degree or she didn't (she doesn't); she either attended Oxford University for a year or for a semester (she attended only for a summer); she attended on a Fulbright scholarship (wrong and often repeated); her family is descended from General Robert E. Lee (fanciful, but not true).<br>&nbsp;<br>For almost a year I myself wondered if I had enough information to flesh out a full-length book. Lee's growing up in Monroeville was colorfully eccentric but unremarkable except for what she heard, read, saw, and thought about. Although her family was upper-middle-class, the impact of the Depression turned Monroeville into a narrow world. "We had to use our own devices in our play, for our entertainment," Lee said later. "We didn't have much money. Nobody had any money. We didn't have toys, nothing was done for us, so the result was that we lived in our imagination most of the time."<br>&nbsp;<br>Harper Lee and Truman Capote became friends as next-door neighbors in the late 1920s, when they were about kindergarten age. From the start they recognized in each other "an apartness," as Capote later expressed it; and both loved reading. When Lee's father gave them an old Underwood typewriter, they began writing original stories together. Capote moved to New York City in the third grade to join his mother and stepfather, but he returned to Monroeville most summers, rekindling his friendship with Lee.<br>&nbsp;<br>In high school she was fortunate to have a gifted English teacher, Gladys Watson-Burkett, who introduced her to challenging literature and to the rigors of writing well. Lee's preferred authors became nineteenth-century British writers, with Jane Austen as her favorite. Nelle once remarked that her ambition as a writer was to "become the Jane Austen of south Alabama."<br>&nbsp;<br>She spent her freshman year of college at Huntingdon College, a Methodist school for women in Montgomery, but transferred to the University of Alabama in 1945. Unable to fit in with the sisters of the sorority she joined, she found a better community of friends on the campus newspaper. Eventually, she became editor in chief of the Rammer Jammer, a quarterly on-campus humor magazine. Her junior year, she entered the university's law school but was unhappy about this career choice. Despite her father's hopes that she would become an attorney like her sister Alice and practice in Monroeville, Lee went to New York in 1949 to become a writer.<br>&nbsp;<br>She spent eight years at odd jobs until friends loaned her enough money to live on for a year so that she could write full-time. Even so, the manuscript she showed Tay Hohoff, an editor at J. B. Lippincott, resembled a string of stories instead of a novel. Two and a half years of rewriting followed, under Hohoff's guidance. At last, To Kill a Mockingbird was completed and slated for publication in July 1960. Lee opted for the name "Harper Lee" on the book's cover because she didn't want to be referred to erroneously in the press as "Nellie." In the meantime, Truman Capote asked her to accompany him to Kansas as his "assistant researchist" on a project for the New Yorker magazine. Their intense partnership as they researched the murder of a farm family in Holcomb, Kansas, resulted in In Cold Blood (1965), one of the outstanding nonfiction works of post-World War II literature. Capote slighted Lee, however, by hardly acknowledging her help.<br>&nbsp;<br>To Kill a Mockingbird appeared to highly favorable reviews and quickly climbed to the top of bestseller lists, where it remained for more than eighty weeks. In 1961, the novel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. A film adaptation was released in 1962, starring Gregory Peck, and received three Academy Awards.<br>&nbsp;<br>Although fans of To Kill a Mockingbird waited for the second novel about a southern town that Lee said she was writing, it never came. She also researched a book similar to In Cold Blood, about a part-time reverend in Alexander City, Alabama, who was accused of killing five people for their insurance money and was later murdered himself by one of his victims' relatives. But she dropped the project in the 1990s.<br>&nbsp;<br>Initially, that was about all I could uncover.<br>&nbsp;<br>To find people who may have known Lee at one time, I occasionally relied on unorthodox methods that were surprisingly effective. To begin with, I joined an online reunion service and contacted everyone listed who had attended Lee's schools during the years she was enrolled. This yielded some correspondents. The Huntingdon College alumni directory carried not only names and addresses but, in many cases, e-mails. Thus, I added more names to my list of people to talk with and write to. The alumni directory of the University of Alabama was available on CD, again with mailing addresses and e-mails. One day, I recall e-mailing three hundred Ala...</p><h2>Your Child&#39;s Strengths: Discover Them, Develop Them, Use Them</h2><p>With this groundbreaking work, renowned educator Jenifer Fox argues against the flawed and maddening paradigm that "fixing"kids' weaknesses is the way to achieve success. Rather, Fox promotes focusing on kids' natural inclinations in three interdependent areas: Activity Strengths, Relationship Strengths, and Learning Strengths. Pairing inspiring firsthand accounts of success with practical workbook tools, alongside an outline of the award-winning strengths-based Affinities curriculum Fox has implemented in her own school, <i>Your Child's Strengths</i> is a user-friendly and indispensable guide for parents, teachers, and administrators alike.</p><p>Jenifer Fox, M.Ed., has worked in day and boarding schools, single-sex and coed schools, as a teacher and administrator for twenty-five years. She is currently head of the Purnell School in Pottersville, New Jersey. She holds a B.S. in communications from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and M.A. in English from Middlebury College, and a M.Ed. in school administration from Harvard University. She lives in Pottersville, New Jersey.Jenifer Fox makes a compelling case that our education system ("an anxiety-producing machine") is not working for students. Because that system focuses on labeling and fixing weaknesses rather than on celebrating strengths, Fox argues, students' abilities get overlooked or negated, leading many to abandon interest in school altogether. Ren&#x2c6;�e Raudman delivers Fox's provocative message--laced with plentiful anecdotes and illustrations--in sometimes curiously distracting tones that often strike the ear as plaintive or wistful-sounding. Her reenactments of conversations are better, though overall her soft-spoken voice can seem overly emotional in a way that may distract some listeners from Fox's material until they're used to her style. Nonetheless, listeners will learn a lot from this provocative and practical book, which will strike a chord with many parents and teachers.

Far from Calcutta, the city of their childhood, and after years of living separate lives, Anju and Sudha rekindle their friendship in America. The deep-seated love they feel for each other provides the support each of them needs. It gives Anju the strength to pick up the pieces of her life after a miscarriage, and Sudha the confidence to make a life for herself and her baby daughter, Dayita&#x2013;without her husband. The women&#x2019;s bond is shaken to the core when they must confront the deeply passionate feelings that Anju&#x2019;s husband has for Sudha.

As one character says, "All immigrants are dreamers, but they're practical about it. They know what's OK to dream about, and what isn't." Though it's a sequel to Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's <i>Sister of My Heart</i>, the novel stands alone as an exploration of the contemporary immigrant experience.

Henry lived a turbulent life including a brief spell in jail on a charge of embezzlement. Whilst there, he began writing and, once released, made a name for himself as a prolific short-story writer. He has ten collections and over 600 short stories in print. He died in 1910. P. J. Lynch is one of today&#39;s most talented and revered illustrators. He has twice won the Kate Greenaway Medal, in 1995 for The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey, and in 1997 for When Jessie Came Over the Sea (9780744569636). He is also the illustrator of the bestselling A Christmas Carol and East O&#39; the Sun and West O&#39; the Moon (9781844284986). P. J. lives in Dublin.O. Henry's classic story has been embellished in this adaptation performed by the St. Charles Players. In this production, Della is rummaging through the attic on a Christmas Eve with her granddaughter. This brings back memories of a Christmas Eve many years before, and she tells the story of how she and Jim Dillingham met and courted, leading to the story we know so well. All of the performers in this work are splendid. Della, young and not so young, is vivacious and full of spunk. Jim is a confident, ambitious young man who is smitten by Della. Granddaughter cannot get enough of the story. While not faithful to the story in many respects (the setting, for example), this delightful and entertaining production is faithful to its spirit.

Foster writes about Portland, Oregon and the towns around it. In her books, readers take long walks into urban neighborhoods: through streetcar districts and parks, up and down stairways, beyond dead-ends, along river beaches, atop volcanic peaks and anywhere that a curious person would want to explore. She crafts routes designed to get urban walkers to places others often miss exploring, and her walks weaves geology, architecture, history, ethnobotany and horticulture into a story about each place. Every walk also passes through a local commercial district where coffee, beer, books, and other joys of urban exploring will be found. She designs her routes so that each one makes for a small urban holiday, good for locals and visitors too, who want to get beyond the tourist highlights of one of the nation&#39;s most walkable cities.&#x201c;Skillfully combines neighborhood history and architectural description with keen observations guaranteed to capture a walker's imagination.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<i><b>The Oregonian</b></i></p><h2>The Wrath of Fu Manchu</h2><p>This book brings together some unpublished manuscripts, and stories which have previously appeared only in magazine form, by the late Sax Rohmer.

Deci, Ph.D., is a professor of psychology at the University of Rochester and director of its human motivation program.Univ. of Rochester psychology professor Deci and Flaste, former science and health editor for the New York Times, here compile decades of experimentation and research on human motivation conducted by Deci and his colleagues. The product is an insightful and provocative meditation on how people can become more genuinely engaged and successful in pursuing their goals?in school, the workplace and relationships. Concerned with what makes people want to succeed, Deci conducted extensive studies demonstrating that when subjects are encouraged to pursue a task for its own sake, they do it better and enjoy it more than those told to do it for a reward or informed that they will be punished if they don't do it correctly. These results lead to his conclusion?amply illustrated through anecdotal and scholarly evidence?that authoritarian motivational strategies such as the reward/punishment systems commonly used in American schools and businesses alienate people from their work, make them less productive and leave them less fulfilled. Deci calls for "autonomy-supportive" behavior from those in positions of authority to encourage motivation emanating from within. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Alichino Volume 1</h2><p>Beautiful creatures called &#34;Alichino&#34; grant any wish to those who find them--but at a price! Age 13 and up.</p><p>- Full color cover and poster insert <br>- Appeals to fans of CLAMP and Angel Sanctuary in the art style of Clover <br>- In the vein of goth culture, embracing such titles as Demon Diary and Pet Shop of Horrors.This example of <i>shojo</i>, manga for teen girls, will captivate anyone by its art alone. The story involves "Alichinos," beautiful, supernatural beings hunted by humans because they have the power to grant wishes; in fact, the name means "those who entice," and the Alichinos actually feed on the souls of those who seek them out. They especially hunger for the "Kusabi," humans born with exceptionally powerful souls who are the only beings able to kill an Alichino. This opening installment introduces Tsugiri, a handsome young Kusabi who is hunted by some Alichinos and protected by others, including one in owl form who has a penchant for spouting sardonic observations. Both sides of Alichinos are mustering their forces as the book ends, so more plot complications are sure to follow. The story has a dark, magical flow to it, but its main attraction is unquestionably the art. Shurei is an award-winning artist in Japan, but this is her first outing as both writer and artist. Each page of this work is a lovely composition, full of the swirling fabric and hair typical of manga but worked into a layout that is as intriguing as it is beautiful. Her exquisitely fine line work and intense characterization enliven the story, while drawing the readers' attention from panel to panel. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The ways Americans cultivated and prepared food and the values they attributed to it played an important role in shaping the identity of the newborn nation. In <i>A Revolution in Eating</i>, James E. McWilliams presents a colorful and spirited tour of culinary attitudes, tastes, and techniques throughout colonial America. <br><br>Confronted by strange new animals, plants, and landscapes, settlers in the colonies and West Indies found new ways to produce food. Integrating their British and European tastes with the demands and bounty of the rugged American environment, early Americans developed a range of regional cuisines. From the kitchen tables of typical Puritan families to Iroquois longhouses in the backcountry and slave kitchens on southern plantations, McWilliams portrays the grand variety and inventiveness that characterized colonial cuisine. As colonial America grew, so did its palate, as interactions among European settlers, Native Americans, and African slaves created new dishes and attitudes about food. McWilliams considers how Indian corn, once thought by the colonists as "fit for swine," became a fixture in the colonial diet. He also examines the ways in which African slaves influenced West Indian and American southern cuisine. <br><br>While a mania for all things British was a unifying feature of eighteenth-century cuisine, the colonies discovered a national beverage in domestically brewed beer, which came to symbolize solidarity and loyalty to the patriotic cause in the Revolutionary era. The beer and alcohol industry also instigated unprecedented trade among the colonies and further integrated colonial habits and tastes. Victory in the American Revolution initiated a "culinary declaration of independence," prompting the antimonarchical habits of simplicity, frugality, and frontier ruggedness to define American cuisine. McWilliams demonstrates that this was a shift not so much in new ingredients or cooking methods, as in the way Americans imbued food and cuisine with values that continue to shape American attitudes to this day.</p><p>James E.

Though the twenty-first century could be the critical era in which life on Earth spreads beyond our solar system, it is just as likely that we have endangered the future of the entire universe. With clarity and precision, Rees maps out the ways technology could destroy our species and thereby foreclose the potential of a living universe whose evolution has just begun.Rees boldly forecasts the startling risks that stem from our accelerating rate of technological advances. We could be wiped out by lethal &#34;engineered&#34; airborne viruses, or by rogue nano-machines that replicate catastrophically. Experiments that crash together atomic nuclei could start a chain reaction that erodes all atoms of Earth, or could even tear the fabric of space itself. Through malign intent or by mistake, a single event could trigger global disaster. Though we can never completely safeguard our future, increased regulation and inspection can help us to prevent catastrophe. Rees&#39;s vision of the infinite future that we have put at risk--a cosmos more vast and diverse than any of us has ever imagined--is both a work of stunning scientific originality and a humanistic clarion call on behalf of the future of life.</p><p>Just when you've stopped worrying and learned to love the bomb, along comes Sir Martin Rees, Britain's Astronomer Royal, with teeming armies of deadly viruses, nanobots, and armed fanatics. Beyond the hazards most of us know about--smallpox, terrorists, global warming--Rees introduces the new threats of the 21st century and the unholy political and scientific alliances that have made them possible. <i>Our Final Hour</i> spells out doomsday scenarios for cosmic collisions, high-energy experiments gone wrong, and self-replicating machines that steadily devour the biosphere. If we can avoid driving ourselves to extinction, he writes, a glorious future awaits; if not, our devices may very well destroy the universe.<p> </p><blockquote>What happens here on Earth, in this century, could conceivably make the difference between a near eternity filled with ever more complex and subtle forms of life and one filled with nothing but base matter.</blockquote><p> For many technological debacles, Rees places much of the blame squarely on the shoulders of the scientists who participate in perfecting environmental destruction, biological menaces, and ever-more powerful weapons. So is there any hope for humanity? Rees is vaguely optimistic on this point, offering solutions that would require a level of worldwide cooperation humans have yet to exhibit. If the daily news isn't enough to make you want to crawl under a rock, this book will do the trick. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p><b>Matrin Rees</b> is a leading researcher on cosmic evolution, black holes, and galaxies.

Though he eventually became a physician and once considered medicine his principal career, he continued to gain popularity and praise as a writer for various Russian newspapers, eventually authoring more literary work and ultimately his most well-known plays, including <em>Ivanov</em>, <em>The Seagull</em>, and <em>Uncle Vanya</em>.

Her portraits of children suffering the brutality of war are particularly wrenching. Szwajger recalls a children's hospital at which she worked as a medical student with a prized "ticket" to travel between the Warsaw ghetto and the "Aryan side." We're shown the youngsters, starving, four to a bed; we feel Szwajger's anguish when the hospital is disbanded and she spares her patients their even crueler fate by administering overdoses of morphine to them. She sears us again at a monastery's children's center, describing its violent closure by the Nazis who hung the slaughtered priests on display. With false identity papers, Szwajger, a "courier girl" for the Jewish Fighting Organization, journeys throughout Poland carrying money to Jews and finding safe houses for them. Her husband is sent to a camp; she escapes a massacre at a Home Army hideout. Then, telling us about another act of euthanasia she committed, she decries: "I don't want to write any more. Not a sentence more. About anything." But it is enough, for Szwajger's testimony makes its impress as a classic.

Mr. Breton said sure, and served the moose some clam chowder. The moose liked the soup, and decided to stay. From that time on, things at the restaurant began to hum.<br>Join the Blue Moose in this hilarious collection of three short novels as he learns to wait tables, writes a novel, goes to Hollywood, solves a mystery, and makes you laugh even in the dark of the cold woods.<br>Includes new wacky but true moose facts!</p><p><b>Daniel Pinkwater</b> has written many popular books for kids. He appears regularly on NPR's <i>Weekend Edition</i> with Scott Simon to discuss children's literature.MOOSE<br>MEETING<br>Mr. Breton had a little restaurant on the edge of the big woods. There was nothing north of Mr. Breton's house except nothing, with trees in between. When winter came, the north wind blew through the trees and froze everything solid. Then it would snow. Mr. Breton didn't like it.<br>Mr. Breton was a very good cook. Every day, people from the town came to his restaurant. They ate gallons of his special clam chowder. They ate plates of his special beef stew. They ate fish stew and Mr. Breton's special homemade bread. The people from the town never talked much and they never said anything about his cooking.<br><br>"Did you like your clam chowder?" Mr. Breton would ask.<br><br>"Yup," the people from the town would say.<br><br>Mr. Breton wished they would say, "Delicious!" or, "Good chowder, Breton!" All they ever said was, "Yup." In winter they came on skis and snowshoes.<br><br>Every morning Mr. Breton went out behind his house to get firewood. He wore three sweaters, a scarf, galoshes, a woolen hat, a big checkered coat, and mittens. He still felt cold. Sometimes animals came out of the woods to watch Mr. Breton. Raccoons and rabbits came. The cold didn't bother them. It bothered Mr. Breton even more when they watched him.<br><br>One morning there was a moose in Mr. Breton's yard. It was a blue moose. When Mr. Breton went out his back door, the moose was there, looking at him. After a while, Mr. Breton went back in, closed the door, and made a pot of coffee while he waited for the moose to go away. It didn't go away; it just stood in Mr. Breton's yard, looking at his back door. Mr. Breton drank a cup of coffee. The moose stood in the yard. Mr. Breton opened the door again. "Shoo! Go away!" he said.<br>"Do you mind if I come in and get warm?" the moose said. "I'm just about frozen." The moose brushed past him and walked into the kitchen. His antlers almost touched the ceiling.<br><br>The moose sat down on the floor next to Mr. Breton's stove. He closed his eyes and sat leaning toward the stove for a long time. Mr. Breton stood in the kitchen, looking at the moose. The moose didn't move. Wisps of steam began to rise from his blue fur. After a long time the moose sighed. It sounded like a foghorn.<br><br>"Can I get you a cup of coffee?" Mr. Breton asked the moose. "Or some clam chowder?"<br><br>"Clam chowder," said the moose.<br><br>Mr. Breton filled a bowl with creamy clam chowder and set it on the floor. The moose dipped his big nose into the bowl and snuffled up the chowder. He made a sort of slurping, whistling noise.<br><br>"Sir," the moose said, "this is wonderful clam chowder."<br><br>Mr. Breton blushed a very deep red. "Do you really mean that?"<br><br>"Sir," the moose said, "I have eaten some very good chowder in my time, and yours is the very best."<br><br>"Oh my," said Mr. Breton, blushing even redder. "Oh my. Would you like some more?"<br><br>"Yes, with crackers," said the moose.<br><br>The moose ate seventeen bowls of chowder with crackers. Then he had twelve pieces of hot gingerbread and forty-eight cups of coffee. While the moose slurped and whistled, Mr. Breton sat in a chair. Every now and then he said to himself, "Oh my. The best he's ever eaten. Oh my."<br><br>Later, when some people from the town came to Mr. Breton's house, the moose met them at the door. "How many in your party, please?" the moose asked. "I have a table for you; please follow me."<br><br>The people from the town were surprised to see the moose. They felt like running away, but they were too surprised. The moose led them to a table, brought them menus, looked at each person, snorted, and clumped into the kitchen.<br><br>"There are some people outside; I'll take care of them," he told Mr. Breton.<br><br>The people were whispering to one another about the moose, when he clumped back to the table.<br><br>"Are you ready to order?"<br><br>"Yup," the people from the town said. They waited for the moose to ask them if they would like some chowder, the way Mr. Breton always did. But the moose just stared at them as though they were very foolish. The people felt uncomfortable. "We'll have the clam chowder."<br><br>"Chaudiere de Clam; very good," the moose said. "Do you desire crackers or homemade bread?"<br><br>"We will have crackers," said the people from the town.<br><br>"I suggest you have the bread; it is hot," said the moose.<br><br>"We will have bread," said the people from the town.<br><br>"And for dessert," said the moose, "will you have fresh gingerbread or Apple Jacquette?"<br><br>"What do you recommend?" asked the people from the town.<br><br>"After the Chaudiere de Clam, the gingerbread is best."<br><br>"Thank you," said the people from the town.<br><br>"It is my pleasure to serve you," said the moose. <br><br>The moose brought bowls of chowder balanced on his antlers.<br><br>At the end of the meal, the moose clumped to the table. "Has everything been to your satisfaction?" he asked.<br><br>"Yup," said the people from the town, their mouths full of gingerbread.<br><br>"I beg your pardon?" said the moose. "What did you say?"<br><br>"It was very good," said the people from the town. "It was the best we've ever eaten."<br><br>"I will tell the chef," said the moose.<br><br>The moose clumped into the kitchen and told Mr. Breton that the people from the town had said that the food was the best they had ever eaten. Mr. Breton rushed out of the kitchen and out of the house. The people from the town were sitting on the porch, putting on their snowshoes.<br><br>"Did you tell the moose that my clam chowder was the best you've ever eaten?" Mr. Breton asked.<br><br>"Yup," said the people from the town, "we said that. We think that you are the best cook in the world; we have always thought so."<br><br>"Always?" asked Mr. Breton.<br><br>"Of course," the people from the town said. "Why do you think we walk seven miles on snowshoes just to eat here?"<br><br>The people from the town walked away on their snowshoes. Mr. Breton sat on the edge of the porch and thought it over. When the moose came out to see why Mr. Breton was sitting outside without his coat on, Mr. Breton said, "Do you know, those people think I am the best cook in the whole world?"<br><br>"Of course they do," the moose said. "Do you want me to go into town to get some crackers? We seem to have run out."<br><br>"Yes," said Mr. Breton, "and get some asparagus too. I'm going to cook something special tomorrow."<br><br>"By the way," said the moose, "aren't you cold out here?"<br><br>"No, I'm not the least bit cold," Mr. Breton said. "This is turning out to be a very mild winter."</p><h2>Home Time: The Ultimate Manual for Dust and Stress-free Living</h2><p>In this down-to-earth book, Jocasta Innes provides a manual for dust and stress-free living.

This colorful guide discusses goats of all types, including dairy goats, used for milk and cheese; meat goats; fiber goats, prized for their mohair and cashmere; recreational goats, beloved by children for their great personalities and silliness; and brush goats, the lawnmowers of creative hobby farmers and suburbanites. Weaver offers excellent advice on how to purchase a goat: sensible and direct, she advises newcomers that while goats can be profitable, they should not rush in. Before the reader fills his backyard with a herd of goats, the author warns him or her to consider that while goats are cute, personable, charming, and imminently entertaining [they] are also destructive mischievous, sometimes ornery, and often exasperating.&#x201d; The book lists the various breeds of goats commonly available as meat and dairy producers, carefully spelling out their advantages and drawbacks. In the chapter on selecting a goat, the author instructs the reader to be aware of the overall health and soundness, and to consider such the animals&#x2019; horns and teeth. The book also covers general care for a small herd of goats, including outdoor housing and feeding, general health care, and maintenance. For hobby farmers ready to dive into the world of reproducing their goats, there are chapters on breeding, mating, and Bringing Kids into the World.&#x201d; All goat keepers will be enlightened by the information in the chapter on behavior and solving everyday problems with their often capricious caprines. Since the focus of the book is for hobby farmers, Goats also addresses how to make money from the small-scale herd, offering advice on managing, selling, and marketing goat-derived products. The book concludes with an extensive glossary of over 150 terms, an appendix of common goat diseases, and a resource section of useful goat-relevant books, websites, and associations. Fully indexed.</p><p>Advance Praise for Goats: <p>"This book is an excellent resource for all goat owners or prospective goat owners. Ms. Weaver presents an interesting and detailed history of goats, full descriptions of individual breeds and their purposes, and a synopsis of goat medical care. Best of all, she has prepared an extensive list of online sources of more detailed goat information and of goat equipment and books." &#x2014;Lorrie Boldrick, DVM, coauthor of Pygmy Goats: Management and Veterinary Care and the Illustrated Standard of the Pygmy Goat </p><p>"I was blown away with Sue Weaver&#x2019;s new book, Hobby Farm: Goats.

He has designed flowers for the great fashion houses of Dior and Chanel as well as for the Cannes Film Festival. From a simple yet striking circular bouquet of tulips tied in raffia to glorious bursts of dahlias in wax vases, from delicate rose petals and orchids floating in silver shells to an enchanting mix of water lilies and hyacinths in transparent glass, more than 100 color photographs taken exclusively for this book bring to life the astonishing still-life arrangements of this internationally heralded French floral designer. This lavishly illustrated volume will be a treasured gift for all plant and flower lovers.</p><p>"Nature is a good guide; it teaches us everything," says master floral designer Christian Tortu. It is the perfect summation of his work. Unpretentious yet stunningly beautiful, Tortu's arrangements have drawn inspiration directly from his childhood treks through the countryside of his native town of Anjou, France.<p> <i>Sensational Bouquets by Christian Tortu</i> is at once an intimate profile of the artist--who has designed floral arrangements for Dior and Chanel, as well as for the Cannes Film Festival--and a useful guide to how he creates his exciting and unique bouquets. </p><p> Tortu always looks to nature for inspiration. There, he finds freedom: of form, of color, of scent, all mixed together flawlessly, without artifice or ostentation. Paying homage to nature's inherent sense of design, Tortu creates stunning arrangements while bending all the rules of traditional flower arranging. Unexpected plants join in clever, surprising combinations to celebrate the drama of nature--of birth and death, and everything in between. Garden roses nestle in a tangle of blackberry branches much as they would in an overgrown garden. Wild thistles poke their prickly blossoms out of a bunch of softer, rounder bred thistles and speak of a miraculous harmony between wild and cultivated plants. Green almonds, lotus fruit, and poppy capsules come together in an enthralling play of yellow against green.</p><p> As if Sylvain Thomas's sumptuous photographs of Tortu's arrangements weren't inspiration enough, the text of <i>Sensational Bouquets</i> reads like poetry. This book will both motivate and guide readers to toss out what they've learned about flower arranging and let nature and their own unbridled intuition dictate how they assemble their next gathering of wild and/or cultivated plants. <i>--Robin Donovan</i></p>SYLVAIN THOMAS is a photographer for the French magazine R�sidences D�coration.

When Alexander died in late 2003, he had completed most of Rules of Engagement, leaving behind notes on how the remainder of the story was to unfold. The novel has been completed by John Shannon and Alexander&#39;s wife, Judith Aller. Shannon himself is the author of four novels as well as six books in the highly praised Jack Liffey mystery series, most recently Terminal Island.Starred Review. Alexander's many fans will find the final, posthumous Sir John Fielding mystery (after 2003's <i>The Price of Murder</i>) a bittersweet experience. It marks a triumphant return to the series' strengths, with the blind magistrate Fielding, the real-life founder of London's fledgling police force, the Bow Street Runners, once again playing a prominent role in unraveling a baffling crime. When Lord Lammermoor, who's involved in drafting emergency legislation to combat the American rebels on the eve of the Revolutionary War, falls to his death from Westminster Bridge, the insightful sleuth and his loyal legman, Jeremy Proctor, uncover clues suggesting that the lord was murdered, possibly through a form of hypnotism. While the guilty party's identity is obvious fairly early on, the author's gifts for vivid characterizations, colorful period details and fast pacing are very much in evidence. His two collaborators deserve acclaim for making it impossible to tell where Alexander's words end and theirs begin, and for enabling one of the worthier recent historical series to go out on a well-deserved high note. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It&#x2019;s as though we&#x2019;re undertaking a bizarre social experiment to see how much inequality a democratic society can tolerate. <br><br> As a result &#x201c;We are the 99%,&#x201d; the rallying cry of the Occupy movement, has spread far beyond its ranks. But who are the 99 percent? Who are the 1 percent? How extensive and systematic is inequality throughout society? What are its true causes and consequences? How is inequality changing in our world? And what can be done about it? <br><br> For many years Chuck Collins has been a leading voice and activist on these questions. In this book he marshals wide-ranging data from a variety of sources to paint a graphic picture of how disparities in wealth and power play out in America and the world. For the first time, this book reveals the concrete meaning of &#x201c;the 99% and the 1%,&#x201d; looking not just at individual households but at the business world, the media, and the earth as a whole. <br><br> Collins identifies the shifts in social values, political power, and economic policy that have led to our current era of extreme inequality&#x2014;particularly the way Wall Street has managed to rig the rules of the game in favor of the 1perecent&#x2014;and surveys the havoc inequality has wreaked on virtually every aspect of society. But there is hope. Not only does he offer common-sense proposals for closing the inequality gap, but Collins provides a guide to many of the groups&#x2014;including some made up of millionaires&#x2014;that are working to bring about a society that works for everybody: for the 100 percent. This is a struggle that can be won.

It&#x2019;s the primer for the 99 percent movement to rebuild an economy that works for the 100 percent.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Van Jones, President, Rebuild the Dream, and author of <i>The</i> <i>Green Collar Economy</i></b><i><br> </i><br> &#x201c;So if you&#x2019;re rich, you&#x2019;re important; if you&#x2019;re not, you&#x2019;re worthless?

Collins has been an intrepid advocate for greater equality for years, and he grasps the potential of the Occupy Wall Street movement to reverse the &#x2018;inequality death spiral.&#x2019; This is a passionate and powerful call to arms to save the planet from the clutches of the greedy few.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Linda McQuaig, coauthor of <i>Billionaires&#x2019; Ball</i> <br> </b><br> &#x201c;Chuck Collins not only gives us the hard cold facts about inequality in America but also shares with us his gift for optimism. While he warns us that the hour is late to halt the downward spiral of inequality and environmental destruction, the power to make positive change still lies within us, waiting for the spark of renewal. With this remarkable book, Chuck is doing all that he can to rekindle that spark so that together we can fight for real change.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Les Leopold, author of <i>The</i> <i>Looting of America<br> </i></b><br> &#x201c;Chuck Collins concisely summarizes the data on income and wealth inequality and in a calm, clear voice reveals why inequality is increasing and what we must do to reverse it.&nbsp;If you are to read one thing this year about inequality and its impact on America, you must read this book.

Over the past few months, he&#x2019;d listened to a hundred of Alfie&#x2019;s dreams. They usually starred Albert Einstein, Neil deGrasse Tyson, or the local weatherwoman, and they seemed to go on forever. If they&#x2019;d been nightmares, Charlie would have happily tuned in. Nightmares were his specialty, and he considered himself an expert on the subject. As far as Charlie was concerned, there was nothing more boring than someone else&#x2019;s good dreams. And kale. Good dreams and kale.<br><br>But Charlie happened to be in a generous mood. It was the first hot day of summer vacation, and he and Alfie were lounging on a bench outside the Cypress Creek ice cream shop. A triple-decker cone with scoops of rum raisin, mint chocolate chip, and bubble gum ice cream was slowly making its way into Charlie&#x2019;s belly. He had an hour to kill before he was due back at his summer job, and he couldn&#x2019;t have felt more content.<br><br>&#x201c;Why not,&#x201d; he told Alfie. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hear it.&#x201d;<br><br>As Alfie began to talk, Charlie sat back against the bench and let his gaze drift over the roof of the hardware store across the street--and up to the strange purple mansion that stood on a hill overlooking the town. Workmen on ladders had just finished painting the house, covering the dingy grape color with a fresh coat of lilac. At the top of the mansion, an octagonal tower rose into the sky. One of the tower&#x2019;s windows was open, and a kite in the shape of a pterodactyl was riding the breeze outside. The hand that held its string belonged to Charlie&#x2019;s little brother, Jack. The weird purple mansion was their home.<br><br>As Charlie listened to Alfie chattering away, he made a game of licking each drip of ice cream just before it reached the edge of his cone, and let Alfie&#x2019;s dream pass in one ear and out the other. A few random phrases managed to lodge themselves in his brain: cumulonimbus, El Ni�o, heat wave, high-pressure zone.<br><br>Just as Charlie popped the last bit of cone into his mouth, Alfie&#x2019;s dream finally reached its end.<br><br>&#x201c;So what do you suppose it means?&#x201d; Alfie asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Same thing as every other dream you&#x2019;ve had in the past three months,&#x201d; Charlie replied, still crunching on the cone. &#x201c;It means you&#x2019;ve got a crush on the weatherwoman from the Channel Four news.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a meteorologist,&#x201d; Alfie corrected him, clearly offended that his epic dream had been reduced to a single sentence. &#x201c;And she has a name, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stormy Skies is not a real name,&#x201d; Charlie informed his friend.<br><br>&#x201c;How can you say that?&#x201d; Alfie pouted. Love had turned his once-impressive brain to mush. &#x201c;Are you trying to tell me Stormy just made it up? I&#x2019;d like to hear you say that to Mr. and Mrs. Skies!&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie was searching for a way to break the truth gently, when his attention was drawn across the street by the slam of a car door. An odd-looking man had emerged from a beaten-up black SUV. Smoke was billowing from under the hood, and several of its windows were shattered. The man who'd emerged was tall, with messy dark hair. He might have passed for an average suburban dad in his polo shirt and jeans, but something was clearly wrong with the guy. He was shuffling down the sidewalk, his head bent so far to the side that it appeared to be resting on one of his shoulders. As his feet slid forward, the soles of his Crocs barely left the ground. And though Charlie was sitting too far away to tell for sure, he would have sworn that the man&#x2019;s eyes were shut.<br><br>Charlie nudged Alfie and pointed. &#x201c;Check it out. What&#x2019;s your diagnosis?&#x201d;<br><br>Alfie adjusted his chunky black glasses and examined the man across the street. &#x201c;Hmmm. Let&#x2019;s see. Rigid limbs. Shambling gait. Shocking lack of personal hygiene. And a pretty painful-looking crick in the neck. All things considered, I&#x2019;d say there&#x2019;s a good chance he&#x2019;s the walking dead.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie sat bolt upright on the edge of the bench. It had been months since he&#x2019;d felt such a jolt of excitement. &#x201c;You think that guy might be a zombie?&#x201d;<br><br>Alfie cackled and licked his cone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m joking. How could he be a zombie? The portal to the Netherworld is closed.&#x201d; As soon as Alfie said it, the smile slid off his face, and he slowly turned to Charlie. &#x201c;It is still closed, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; he almost whispered.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course it is,&#x201d; Charlie assured him. &#x201c;Why wouldn&#x2019;t it be?&#x201d;<br><br>That answer wasn&#x2019;t good enough for either of them. Both boys went silent as their gazes turned to the house on the hill.<br>The purple mansion where Charlie lived wasn&#x2019;t like the other houses in Cypress Creek. While the rest of the village was as cute as a pack of puppies, the mansion looked more like an enormous dragon perched on top of a rock. It had claimed its hill before Cypress Creek had been founded, and its occupants had been watching over the town ever since.<br><br>A man named Silas DeChant had built the mansion, and Charlie&#x2019;s stepmother, Charlotte, was Silas&#x2019;s great-great-granddaughter. For the past one hundred and fifty years, some member of the DeChant family had been in residence at the mansion. It was the family&#x2019;s duty to protect the world from the house&#x2019;s terrible secret.<br><br>That secret could be found in the small, eight-sided room at the top of the mansion&#x2019;s tower. The special few who knew about the secret called it the portal. It was a door between the Waking World and the land of nightmares. Fortunately, not many people had ever heard of it. Most humans only visited the Netherworld when they fell asleep, and the terrifying creatures that dwelled there were supposed to stay there.<br><br>But the portal had been opened by accident twice in the past. Nightmares had snuck into Cypress Creek, and unspeakable things had come close to happening. If the portal ever opened again and Nightmares entered the Waking World, it would be up to the portal&#x2019;s protectors to round up the creatures and get them back to the other side. For almost two centuries, a single person had always held the job. Now, for the first time, the portal had three guardians living in the purple mansion. Charlie Laird was one of them.<br>Back on the bench outside the ice cream shop, Charlie and Alfie watched as the zombielike man slammed through the door of the hardware store across the street.<br><br>&#x201c;I should find out what&#x2019;s going on,&#x201d; Charlie said, his heart racing.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming with you.&#x201d; Alfie stuffed the rest of his cone into his mouth and tossed his napkin into the trash.<br><br>They made it to the store&#x2019;s plate-glass window in time to see the man slap a bill on the counter and then lurch toward the door, his arms laden with cans of paint.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, mister, don&#x2019;t forget your change!&#x201d; the clerk called as the door swung open. The man shuffled out to the sidewalk, showing no sign that he&#x2019;d heard.<br><br>Now the strange man was headed in the boys&#x2019; direction. As the guy got closer, Charlie could see that his eyes were open--just barely. But there wasn&#x2019;t much life behind them. A thin stream of drool was trickling from a corner of his mouth. It fed the giant wet splotch that was growing on the front of his shirt, above a small insignia sewn onto his left shirt pocket. The logo looked like a flaming soccer ball.<br><br>Charlie and Alfie scuttled behind a parked car and ducked just seconds before the man passed by. A terrible odor trailed in the man&#x2019;s wake, and Charlie covered his face with his hand. Dead or alive, the guy hadn&#x2019;t bathed in a while.<br><br>Once the man had passed, Charlie let his breath out. &#x201c;Did you get a look at the logo on his shirt?&#x201d; Charlie whispered to Alfie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure I&#x2019;ve seen it somewhere before.&#x201d;<br><br>Alfie squinted. &#x201c;I can barely see anything. My eyes are still watering from the smell, and now my glasses are all fogged up. That man was . . . pungent. Any idea where you might have seen the logo?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Charlie admitted. He stepped out from behind the car. &#x201c;It looks like we&#x2019;re just going to have to ask the guy where he&#x2019;s from.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No way!&#x201d; Alfie yelped as he wiped his glasses. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to talk to that man!&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem, Bluenthal?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;You scared?&#x201d;<br><br>The word scared had a magical effect on Alfie. It lifted him up and straightened out his spine. &#x201c;Yes, I am,&#x201d; he replied without a hint of embarrassment. &#x201c;Are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Terrified,&#x201d; Charlie confirmed. &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s why we have to do it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d; Alfie sighed, deflating. Their travels in the Netherworld had taught them a lot. The most important lesson, though, was to never run from a Nightmare creature. To make one go away, you had to face what scared you. If you tried to escape, the Nightmare would just feed off your fear. Soon it would start showing up in your dreams every night.<br><br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Charlie said. &#x201c;&#x2019;Cause I don&#x2019;t think we want that guy paying us a visit after dark. Now hurry up, or we&#x2019;ll miss him.&#x201d; The man had almost reached his car.<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me!&#x201d; Alfie called. &#x201c;Sir!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, you with the paint!&#x201d; Charlie shouted. There was no time to be polite. The man grunted loudly in response but didn&#x2019;t turn around.<br><br>Charlie shot Alfie a worried look. It wasn&#x2019;t a good sign. Along with shuffling and drooling, grunting was classic zombie behavior.<br><br>&#x201c;Can we interest you in a nice, juicy brain?&#x201d; Alfie yelled.<br><br>&#x201c;Mmmrumph?&#x201d; The man&#x2019;s head swiveled toward the boys while his legs kept walking. Suddenly he jerked to a stop and dropped the cans. Blue paint flew everywhere as the man&#x2019;s knees buckled and he fell to the ground in a lifeless heap. A red gash was already forming across his forehead. He&#x2019;d walked straight into a lamppost.<br><br>&#x201c;Quick, call 911!&#x201d; Charlie told Alfie as he ran toward the fallen man. When Charlie reached him, he dropped to his knees, took off the button-up he was wearing over his Hazel&#x2019;s Herbarium work T-shirt, and prepared to press it against the man&#x2019;s wound. But the expression on the man&#x2019;s face made Charlie pause. Despite the blood, the guy looked strangely peaceful. He lay there with his eyes closed and a pleasant smile on his lips, as if he were enjoying a good night&#x2019;s sleep.<br><br>Alfie squatted beside Charlie. &#x201c;An ambulance is on the way,&#x201d; he said. Then he noticed the man&#x2019;s odd expression. &#x201c;Wow, somebody really needed a nap.&#x201d; Alfie took off his backpack and began searching for tools. &#x201c;Now that he&#x2019;s out, let&#x2019;s have a look at our specimen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The guy may be a zombie, but that doesn&#x2019;t make him a science experiment,&#x201d; Charlie cautioned his friend. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not allowed to dissect him, Alfie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t dissect a person until he&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d; Alfie had fished a small flashlight out of his backpack. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure this guy is still alive, so technically it would be vivisection. But don&#x2019;t worry--no cutting.&#x201d; He pried open one of the man&#x2019;s eyelids and shined the flashlight&#x2019;s beam into his eye. &#x201c;Yep, pupillary reflex is good. Brain stem is working just fine.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie used his free hand to pluck the wallet out of the man&#x2019;s pocket and pass it to his friend. &#x201c;Thanks, Dr. Bluenthal. Now see if you can find some ID while I search the rest of him.&#x201d;<br><br>Alfie riffled through the man&#x2019;s bulging wallet and pulled out a blue-and-yellow card. &#x201c;This guy really needs to organize his stuff. What the heck is Blockbuster Video?&#x201d; After a few more attempts, he finally located a driver&#x2019;s license. &#x201c;Says here the guy&#x2019;s name is Winston Lindsay. He&#x2019;s forty-four. An organ donor. Lives at twenty-seven Newcomb Street in Orville Falls.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Orville Falls?&#x201d; Charlie repeated incredulously. Orville Falls was a cute little town nestled in the mountains. It was about half an hour&#x2019;s drive from Cypress Creek, though Charlie rarely visited. &#x201c;He came all the way here to buy paint? Don&#x2019;t they have a hardware store in Orville Falls?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Actually, they have two,&#x201d; Alfie said.<br><br>Charlie looked at Alfie. Sometimes Charlie wondered if the kid really did know everything.<br><br>Alfie sighed. &#x201c;Remember the summer my parents sent me to that horrible camp in Orville Falls? The counselors locked me up and forced me to do crafts. I had to sneak out just to borrow books from the library.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How could I forget,&#x201d; Charlie said, grinning at the memory of the gifts Alfie had presented to his friends at the end of the ordeal. &#x201c;I still have that macram� owl you made for me.&#x201d;<br><br>They heard the wail of a siren in the distance. Within seconds, it had grown to a deafening pitch as an ambulance screeched to a stop on Main Street and two EMTs in crisp blue uniforms leaped from the back.<br><br>&#x201c;Afternoon,&#x201d; said one in a booming voice fit for a superhero. &#x201c;You the two kids who called this in?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; grunted Alfie. For a moment, it seemed like all he could do was stare up at the EMT in awe. Then Charlie nudged him, and the science spilled out. &#x201c;The subject is unconscious, but his pupillary reflex indicates--&#x201d;<br><br>A second EMT pushed past Alfie and squatted beside Winston Lindsay. &#x201c;Nice work stopping the bleeding,&#x201d; she praised Charlie as she examined the man&#x2019;s wound. &#x201c;You boys in the Scouts or something?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; said Charlie. He rarely used the word ma&#x2019;am, but this was one of the few adults who actually seemed to warrant it.<br><br>Charlie saw Alfie&#x2019;s spine stiffen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a Boy Scout, but I do consider myself something of an amateur doctor,&#x201d; Alfie said proudly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve studied all the major texts, and--&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great, little buddy,&#x201d; the first EMT interrupted. Then he began to unload the stretcher while his partner examined the patient.<br><br>&#x201c;Pupillary reflex appears to be fine,&#x201d; the partner announced. &#x201c;But looks like this dude&#x2019;s going to be out for a while. We need to get him in ASAP.&#x201d;<br><br>Alfie turned to Charlie and rolled his eyes. Charlie could imagine how annoyed his friend felt. It was hard enough being twelve years old; most adults barely listened to a word you said. Being a twelve-year-old genius had to be particularly frustrating.<br><br>The EMTs hoisted Winston Lindsay onto the stretcher, strapped him down, and loaded him into the back of the ambulance. Charlie and Alfie began to climb in after him.<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Fraid not, little men,&#x201d; said one of the EMTs, pushing them away. &#x201c;Only family members get to ride in the back.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Ruins of the Heart</h2><p>Western culture has no convenient category for Melvlana Jelaluddin Rumi.

Ever wondered who loves money more than life? What doors do the secret keys unlock? What old lady wears fur jackets? Who needs to punch a boxing ball before work? With primary evidence from the very private lives of those contemporary authors that are lingering on the doorstep of the literary canon, <i>How I Write</i> is an editorial powerhouse of more than sixty original features by Jonathan Franzen, Jeffrey Eugenides, Joyce Carol Oates, Rick Moody, Will Self, Nicole Krauss, and many others. Letters, photographs, drawings, even candy wrappers, phone bills, and other scattered mementos will be strikingly presented in this smartly designed volume. Using the same research team that previously published the unknown letters of Hunter S. Thompson, Charles Dickens's notebook, Harold Pinter's blues lyrics, and a nude shot of Alan Ginsberg, <i>How I Write</i> offers unpublished and unseen material illuminating the secret lives of authors. A must-have for the growing fan base of <i>McSweeny's</i> and other literary magazines, the book, designed by legendary and award-winning art director Vince Frost, will also be a perfect gift for all writers, readers, and anyone interested in books, ideas, and design.</p><p><b>Dan Crowe</b> was the editor of <i>Zembla</i> magazine, the award-winning international literary magazine, and is currently the literary editor of <i>Another</i> magazine."How I Write: The Secret Lives of Authors" (RIzzoli, 186 pages, $35) offers a compendium in which 78 writers are asked the standard questions: Where do you get your ideas How do you deal with writer's block? What are the highs and lows of a day? Behavioral quirks rule, to no one's surprise. A talismanic aura of one sort or another touches these writerly days. -- <i>The Wall Street Journal August 2007</i><br><br>"We expected to give it a glance and put it down, but instead we were captivated..." -- <i>Arizona Republic </i><br><br>"gives you voyeuristic glimpses" -- <i>Black Book </i><br><br>HOW I WRITE is going to appeal less to writers than it is to design freaks, because, like a book in the hands of Chip Kidd -it's an exceedingly well-designed tome for your coffee table, playful with typography and smart with the art, whether drawn or photographed. You can read it if you want to, but you'll be blown away by Vince Frost's design job -- <i>Bookgasm.com </i><br><br>How I Write edited by Dan Crowe (Rizzoli) 192 pages Jonathan Franzen uses a squeaky, battered green office chair. Will Self uses Post-it notes. Douglas Coupland uses chocolate. Jay McInerney uses an axe. What for, you ask? To write. That's right: to write. And that's what this charming book is all about. Not why these people write, but how. It's about their habits and, more importantly, their talismans. Where do they get their inspiration? Their ideas? How do they keep those ideas organized? Imagine walking into the office of Joyce Carol Oates or A.S. Byatt, and you'd see portraits in the office of the former, a cabinet of curiosities in the latter. Written in short bursts of chapters by the authors themselves, the book comes across almost as a confessional, a "come in and see what I'm all about" sort of thing. It's embarrassingly addictive and impossible to put down. Movie stars. TV stars. Sports stars. Just about any early evening entertainment news program will tell you everything you need to know. But authors? Nah. To what they're really all about, you need this terrific book. Give it to someone you know who is as addicted to Nicholson Baker and Melissa Bank as others are to Brad and Angelina. -- Tony Buchsbaum -- <i>January Magazine, December 3, 2007</i><br><br>That's why books like How I Write: The Secret Lives of Authors tend[s] to ...appeal to the literary voyeur in all of us..." (with images form the book) -- <i>Chicago Sun-Times </i><br><br>What makes this book so interesting? Crowe asked well-known writers to submit descriptions of the "object, picture or document inyour study (that) reveals most about the relationship between living and writing." Sounds gimmicky at best. We expected to give it a glance and put it down, but instead we were captivated, and we've figured out why: The texxt in the book was written by competitive, creative people who really know how to tell a story. JOnathan Franzen sent a paragraph about his old office chair, which seems to be made primarily of duct tape. Melissa Bank sent a New York Times photograph of a blindfolded rhinoceros being-lifted from floodwaters. It captures, she said, "the ungainly struggle, the possibility of rescue, the blind faith writing requires." Douglas Coupland offered a scintillating essay on chocolate as a cure for writer's block. Other contributors include Jane Smiley, A.S. Byatt, Will Self, ZZ Packer, Tom Robbins and David Guterson. <p>-The Arizona Republic -- <i>The Ledger, Lakeland FL.

And he notes that these deceits are prominent not only in non-Christian minds but in the professing church as well.</p><p>On the surface, each of these lies may appear at least partially true or even harmless. But, as Dr. Lutzer reveals, each harbors a distinct danger: It isn't biblical, so it puts our faith at risk. In <i>Ten Lies About God</i> he challenges the accuracy of these beliefs:</p> <p><b>Lie 1:</b> God is whatever we want him to be.</p><p><b>Lie 2:</b> Many paths lead into God's presence.</p> <p><b>Lie 3:</b> God is more tolerant than He used to be.</p><p><b>Lie 4:</b> God has personally never suffered.</p> <p><b>Lie 5:</b> God is obligated to save followers of other religions.</p><p><b>Lie 6:</b> God takes no responsibility for natural disasters.</p><p><b>Lie 7:</b> God does not know our decisions before we make them.</p> <p><b>Lie 8:</b> The Fall ruined God's plan.</p><p><b>Lie 9:</b> We must choose between God's pleasures and our own.</p> <p><b>Lie 10:</b> God helps those who help themselves.</p><p>The goal of Dr. Lutzer's study is not only purity of spiritual belief, but an enhanced worship of God.</p></p><p>Dr. Erwin Lutzer is Senior Pastor of the Moody Church in Chicago. The author of several books, including the Gold Medallion award-winning <i>Hitler's Cross<i>, the CBA bestseller, <i>One Minute After You Die</i>, and his latest release, <i>Ten Lies About God</i>, Dr. Lutzer is a featured speaker on the Moody Broadcast Network daily radio broadcast, "Running to Win."

If you don't believe me, just read this book. Dr. Lutzer clearly exposes the lies so many believe to be the 'gospel truth.'"</p> <p><b>Dr. John F. Ankerberg,</b> <i>The John Ankerberg Show</i></p> <p>"This is one of those books that seems to be charged with a strange electricity. The reader can't get through the author's preface without feeling a compulsion to discover the impact of the first chapter-and from there on to the tenth of the 'lies about God.'

The scope of coverage for the patriarchs, prophets and kings of the Old Testament and the life and teachings of Jesus is extensive, and there are good highlights of Paul's life and other events in Acts. Some material on the Epistles and Revelation and a tiny sample of Psalms and Proverbs are also included. All is drawn together into a consistent, well-constructed narrative and written in a lively, easily understood style which still retains the dignity of the original. However, a Christian bias is occasionally present in the imaginative amplification of some passages. Sentences of moderate length and a rich but reasonably familiar vocabulary should suit upper elementary readers. Younger children will enjoy hearing the short, vivid stories read aloud. The 365 sections indicate use as a daily Bible study or devotional. Although the text is in double columns, the print is large and clear, and illustrations of various sizes liven every page. The luminous artwork is realistic, expressive and well researched in detail. Scripture citations are provided for each section.

It is an exhaustive study of the development of the battalion, brigade and divisional signs of the thirty divisions raised by Kitchener's appeal for men. <br><br>While the divisional signs are well known, there has been little authoritative work on the signs worn by the infantry battalions. The book will illustrate the unique cap and shoulder titles used, as well as cloth signs worn to provide easy recognition in the trenches. Each service battalion, of each regiment has a listing, which provides a brief history of the unit and detailed information on the badges worn.<br><br>It is prodigiously illustrated and contains much information, like why a shape or color was chosen, when it was adopted, what size it was, whether it was worn on a helmet, what color the helmet was and even what colors were used on horse transport; the majority of this rich and detailed information has never been published before. What helps make the information accurate and authoritative is that much of it comes from an archive created at the time and from personal correspondence with hundreds of veterans in the 1980s, many of whom still had their badges and often had razor-sharp recollections about wearing them. The book will also provide some comments from these veterans. <br><br>A further unique aspect of the book is that it will look at the uniforms and badges worn before the battalions left the country, providing much new information that will enable people to identify any photographs they have lying around.</p><p>David Bilton is a retired teacher who spends his time looking after his family, working as a University lecturer and researching the Great War.

He had a quick and confident style of painting and the rare ability to create a portrait that not only reflected the likeness of the subject but captured and reflected their character. By 1915 he was a household name. His work drew the attention of leading society figures like Winston Churchill and Lady Diana Cooper, and prominent socialites and debutantes were soon vying for sittings in his Grosvenor Road studio.<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite his success, McEvoy&#x2019;s name was quickly forgotten after he died unexpectedly at the peak of his career in 1927. This is due, in part, to the fact that many of his most accomplished works remain tucked away in private collections, and, in part, to the absence of any reliable literature on his life and work. <i>Divine People</i>, the first major written study of McEvoy&#x2019;s life and work, aims to return this long-neglected artist to the canon of twentieth-century British art.</p><p><b>Erik Akers-Douglas</b> (1910&#x2013;1982) was a biographical writer and author of <i>Chief Whip: The Political Life and Times of Aretas Akers-Douglas</i>. <b>Lawrence Hendra </b>is an art historian and specialist in British portraiture from 1550 to 1950.</p><h2>Sula</h2><p>As girls, Nel and Sula shared each other&#39;s discoveries and dreams in the poor black mid-West of their childhood. Then Sula ran away to live her dreams and Nel got married. Ten years later Sula returns and no one, least of all Nel, trusts her. SULA is the story of the fear that makes people accept self-pity; the fear that will not countenance escape and that justifies itself through myth and legend. Sula herself is cast as a witch and demon by the people who resent her strength. They attack her with the most pervasive weapon of all, the weapon of language and story. But Sula is a woman of power, a wayward force who challenges the smallness of a world that tries to hold her down.</p><p>In <i>Sula</i>, Toni Morrison, winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize for literature, tells the story of two women--friends since childhood, separated in young adulthood, and reunited as grown women. Nel Wright grows up to become a wife and mother, happy to remain in her hometown of Medallion, Ohio. Sula Peace leaves Medallion to experience college, men, and life in the big city, an exceptional choice for a black woman to make in the late 1920s. <p>As girls, Nel and Sula are the best of friends, only children who find in each other a kindred spirit to share in each girl's loneliness and imagination. When they meet again as adults, it's clear that Nel has chosen a life of acceptance and accommodation, while Sula must fight to defend her seemingly unconventional choices and beliefs. But regardless of the physical and emotional distance that threatens this extraordinary friendship, the bond between the women remains unbreakable: "Her old friend had come home.... Sula, whose past she had lived through and with whom the present was a constant sharing of perceptions. Talking to Sula had always been a conversation with herself." </p><p>Lyrical and gripping, <i>Sula</i> is an honest look at the power of friendship amid a backdrop of family, love, race, and the human condition. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>Praise for Toni Morrison reading <b>Sula</b><p>"Toni Morrison's speaking voice contains the same musicality as her prose, and the combination of the two results in a nearly sublime experience." <br>- The Chicago Tribune</p><p>". . . it's a storyteller's voice - older than sound recording, older even than print itself." <br>-The Trenton Times</p><p>"Morrison's remarkable talent for storytelling naturally lends itself to the spoken word."<br> - The Arizona Republic<br></p></p><h2>Jewish Family and Life: Traditions, Holidays, and Values for Today&#39;s Parents and Children</h2><p><i>Jewish Family and Life: Traditions, Holidays, and Values for Today's Parents and Children</i> has become the definitive book for parents to turn to for sound advice on important and current parenting issues. It dispenses invaluable information that is relevant to Jewish families today, whether the family has a mixed marriage, two parents, a single parent, or adoptive parents. The book's three parts--Traditions, Holidays and Values--investigate contemporary issues in raising children and show concrete ways in which Judaism can play a practical role in enriching a family's spiritual and moral education. Each chapter includes lively, hands-on activities that you can do with your kids and simultaneously instill vital cultural and religious education. Vetted by a prestigious advisory board that is co-chaired by Nobel Prize-winner Elie Weisel, this book with help unify the family and re-establish rich traditions that have been lost over the generations.<br></p><p>Yosef I. Abramowitz is editor and Rabbi Susan Silverman is contributing editor of the on-line magazine <i>Jewish Family and Life</i> (jewishfamily.com). Married and the parents of two daughters, they live in Newton, Massachusetts.<br>For many centuries, Jews lived as tiny minorities or in such small communities that often there was no common place such as a synagogue to celebrate life-cycle events and holidays. Family-based home celebrations therefore became part of Jewish life. Many Jews are still isolated and need guidance in developing a home life that revolves around Jewish practices and festivals. These books have been developed to bridge this gap. The Rhythm of Time answers many of the whys and wherefores of Jewish living. The book covers life-cycle events in detail and follows with an excellent overview of the most important Jewish holidays, Jewish observance in the home, and recipes for food to serve at lifecycle events and major holidays. Award-winning journalist Abramowitz and wife Silverman here apply the down-to-earth, hands-on approach of their web site . The book, divided into Traditions, Holidays, and Values, will speak to young parents trying to establish a Jewish home life. The "Hands on Judaism" section at the end of each chapter provides an opportunity for readers to extend their understanding of the information provided. An annotated resource list by topic, a listing of major American Jewish organizations, and a lengthy glossary round out the volume. Contemporary readers will find these books much livelier and more inviting in format than older treatments of the same topic. Public libraries will definitely want one or both.?Olga B.

To measure the development of Chinese women&#x2019;s poetry, one must take into account not only the poems but also the prose writings&#x2015;prefaces, biographies, theoretical tracts&#x2015;that framed them and attempted to shape women&#x2019;s writing as a distinct category of literature. To this end, the anthology contains an extended section of criticism by and about women writers.<br>These poets include empresses, imperial concubines, courtesans, grandmothers, recluses, Buddhist nuns, widows, painters, farm wives, revolutionaries, and adolescent girls thought to be incarnate immortals. Some women wrote out of isolation and despair, finding in words a mastery that otherwise eluded them. Others were recruited into poetry by family members, friends, or sympathetic male advocates. Some dwelt on intimate family matters and cast their poems as addresses to husbands and sons at large in the wide world of men&#x2019;s affairs. Each woman had her own reasons for poetry and her own ways of appropriating, and often changing, the conventions of both men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s verse.<br>The primary purpose of this anthology is to put before the English-speaking reader evidence of the poetic talent that flourished, against all odds, among women in premodern China. It is also designed to spur reflection among specialists in Chinese poetry, inspiring new perspectives on both the Chinese poetic tradition and the canon of female poets within that tradition. This partial history both connects with and departs from the established patterns for women&#x2019;s writing in the West, thus complementing current discussions of &#x201c;feminine writing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well organized and thorough, it fills an enormous gap in Western literature on women&#x2019;s literature in China.&#x201d;&#x2014;Stephen H.

Unfortunately, teens may be put off by Duane's (Spock's World) soap-operatic take on the characters, while nostalgia-crazed baby boomers are likely to find the pacing slow, at least until late in the story. The plot concerns how Spider-Man matches wits with archenemies Venom and Hobgoblin and uses an unnamed alien creature (who has a fondness for eating radioactive material) to try to keep Hobgoblin from destroying New York. The assorted characters' complex histories, drawn from decades' worth of Spider-Man comics, are recapped in chunks of prose that are as stale as Duane's handling of the acting career of Spider-Man's wife, Mary Jane Parker (whose forays into auditions don't reflect the reality of the New York acting scene), or, for that matter, of the requisite juvenile humor (Mary Jane wrinkling her nose at Spider-Man's sweat-soaked suit and suggesting that he create a "summerweight" one). Even so, with his comic books selling at the rate of 200 million a year Spidey clearly has enough fans to make this flawed but still mildly diverting first book in a promised Spider-Man trilogy a big success.

But though Freud compared himself to Copernicus and Darwin, his history as a physician is problematic. Historians have determined that Freud often misrepresented the course and outcome of his treatments&#x2014;so that the facts would match his theories. Today Freud's legacy is in dispute, his commentators polarized into two camps: one of defenders; the other, fierce detractors. </p><p>Peter D. Kramer, himself a practicing psychiatrist and a leading national authority on mental health, offers a new take on this controversial figure, one both critical and sympathetic. He recognizes that although much of Freud's thought is now archaic, the discipline he invented has become an inescapable part of our culture, transforming the way we see ourselves. Freud was a myth-maker, a storyteller, a writer whose books will survive among the classics of our literature. The result of Kramer's inquiry is nothing less than a new standard history of Freud by a modern master of his thought.</p></p><p><p>Referred to as "the father of psychoanalysis," Sigmund Freud is credited with championing the "talking cure" and charting the human unconscious.

One pillar of traditional Chinese medicine is the model that sees qi (life energy) circulating throughout the human body along a series of channels, or energy meridians. When qi can move freely along these channels, we experience good health and a sense of well-being. When our life energy is restricted or blocked--through stress, injury, poor diet, lack of exercise, or overwork--we experience pain and the symptoms of illness. Lined up along the meridians like pearls on a string are sensitive points called acupressure points. It is at these points that the meridians connect to the surface of the body. By massaging the acupressure points on the body&#x2019;s surface, we can release internal energy blockages and allow the health-giving energy to move freely once again. <br> <br>Along with an introduction to the origins and principles of traditional Chinese medicine, <em>The Acupressure Atlas</em> provides the most important basic techniques as well as step-by-step instructions, illustrated in full color, of the practical and specific information needed to put the healing techniques of acupressure at your fingertips.

Austen died at the age of 42 and only six of her books have been published, though all are considered great works of American literature.</p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel. This edition, first published in 2006, follows the second edition of 1813, which corrects errors of the first edition.</p><h2>A Brief History of Seven Killings</h2><p>*WINNER OF THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE 2015* SHORTLISTED FOR THE NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD AND SELECTED AS A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR BY: WIRED GQ BBC CULTURE NEW YORK TIMES, Michiko Kakutani WASHINGTON POST ELECTRIC LITERATURE TIME PUBLISHERS WEEKLY AMAZON HUFFINGTON POST CHICAGO TRIBUNE NEWSWEEK WALL STREET JOURNAL HOUSTON CHRONICLE LIBRARY JOURNAL BOOKPAGE POPSUGAR BUZZFEED SALON, Laura Miller KANSAS CITY STAR L MAGAZINE SEATTLE TIMES BOSTON GLOBE JAMAICA, 1976 Seven gunmen storm Bob Marley&#39;s house, machine guns blazing.

Having finished it&#x2014;and feeling, as I do now, that <i>A Brief History of Seven Killings</i> is one of the best books I&#x2019;ve read all year&#x2014;I went back and identified the reasons why I did not expect to like it. Reason #1&#x2014; <i>The story is an oral history told in multiple voices</i>: that&#x2019;s true, but James&#x2019; enormous talent makes the multiple voices work. Reading the novel is an immersive experience&#x2014;the characters are real, they are engaging, and James uses them to look at all sides of the story. Yes, the multiple points-of-view are difficult at first, but each voice quickly distinguishes itself as unique and important; the payoff is a novel of sweeping scope and emotion. Reason #2&#x2014;<i>Many of the characters speak in Jamaican patois</i>: like many readers, I&#x2019;m not a big fan of dialect on the page. Tell me what they say, not necessarily how they say it. But James pulls it off with remarkable ease. I expected the patois to start to grate once I got further into the book. It never did. The language only added to my understanding of the story and its characters. Reason #3&#x2014;<i>Violence</i>: this is not an easy book, particularly when it comes to violence. It starts early, and there&#x2019;s a lot of it (certainly more than seven killings). But it&#x2019;s there for a reason. By showing the violence, the poverty, and the struggle to survive in 70s Jamaica, James illustrates how the ghetto can change a person. Over time, we see how every man and woman is changed. Reason #4 &#x2013;<i>It&#x2019;s about Jamaica</i>: I hesitate to admit that I wasn&#x2019;t initially interested in a book set in Jamaica. Am I just not interested in a world so different from mine? Whatever the underlying reason, I was wrong to think that way. I could take the easy route and say that this novel is about something more than Jamaica, but that seems obvious. All I can say is: these people were real to me. And like all great novels, James&#x2019; work drew me in, entertained me, and changed me in ways I could not have anticipated. &#x2013;<i>Chris Schluep</i></p>Marlon James was born in Jamaica.

Her studies at Columbia University with Franz Boas resulted in three books, <i>Dakota Texts</i>, <i>Dakota Grammar</i> (a collaboration with Boas), and <i>Speaking of Indians</i>, as well as many other writings.The story of the people of the Plains Indian Dakota culture and Sioux Nation is told through the life of Waterlily from her birth through motherhood. Waterlily is born in the late 1800s during her village's migration to a new site. With permission from her mother-in-law, Waterlily's mother, Blue Bird, steps out of the walking line to go into the woods where, "against a spinning world she struggled to think coherently. Just what was it her grandmother once told a woman -- something about the best position to induce an easy birth?... An eternity passed -- and then, the child was a girl." Within minutes, Blue Bird rejoins the line with Waterlily pressed against her heart. The fabric of life in Waterlily's Dakota camp circle is woven of kinship obligations, ties "that held the people together, impelling them to sacrifice for one another" through joyously observed gift-giving rituals. Waterlily is instructed by the quiet modeling and supervision of all her family, the village elders, and 'kola' - voluntarily bonded friends. Her story is a beautifully written and loving tribute to the strengths and wisdom of Sioux women, and to a culture whose primary desire is to make "duties toward others a privilege and a delight." <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Jesse Larsen</i></p><h2>A Tale of Two Cities (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>Lucie Manette has been separated from her father for&nbsp;18 years while he languished in Paris&#x2019;s most feared prison, the Bastille.

Of course, as a Buddhist monk, his blueprint was created long ago in the form of the Buddha's so-called Noble Eightfold Path. In the same clear language that has made his <i>Mindfulness in Plain English</i> a perennial favorite, <i>Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness</i> is his attempt to explain this timeless path of morality, concentration, and wisdom. The gist of the book comes down to the use of the word <i>skillful</i> in the heading of each of the book's chapters. Living well is a skill that takes both practice and understanding. With stories, bulleted summaries, quotes from the sutras, and, most of all, a knack for relating to our everyday concerns, Henepola Gunaratana skillfully teaches us how to refrain from causing others to suffer. This, along with ending our own suffering, leads to happiness. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Bhante Gunaratana was ordained at the age of twelve as a Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka, earned his PhD in philosophy from The American University, and has led meditation retreats, taught Buddhism, and lectured widely throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia.

She lives in Cambridge, England where she is now at work on the newest Joe Scandilands novel, <i>Folly du Jour.</i><i>Chapter 1</i><br>Champagne, northern France, <br>September 1915<br><br>Aline Houdart got off her bicycle and stood still, holding tightly to the handlebars. At this moment she needed to have her feet firmly on the ground and she fought down a ridiculous urge to take off her shoes, the better to connect herself to the earth. Surely she was mistaken? The sound she'd heard was a tree crashing to the ground in the forest around her. Or thunder. A snap of her starched headdress in the breeze as she rounded the bend perhaps. The explanations she snatched at were elbowed away by a single word: cannon. But at such close quarters?<br><br>Aline thought at once of her parents. They would have been able to identify the make, calibre and direction of fire. Her parents knew all about cannon. In their distant youth they'd been trapped in Paris during the Prussian siege of 1870 and, round a good fire in the wintertime, they still vied with each other to convey the horrors of bombardment by von Moltke's fifty-ton siege gun. Aline tried to recall their lurid accounts of the hellish din with its earth-trembling accompaniment.<br><br>The sound came again. She got her bearings and, as she stood with her face to the north, the late afternoon sun over her left shoulder threw a shadow to the east and north in the direction of the blast. She stretched out an arm, extending the line, trying to remember what lay over there. The plain of Champagne, stretching for wide miles around Suippes and over to the bristling fortifications clustering around Verdun. She could deceive herself no longer. This was heavy artillery, but were the guns French or German? Perhaps General Joffre had begun the longed-for offensive to clear von B�low out of Champagne, but at all events the war was coming closer. No longer static, bogged down in trenches, not even creeping up quietly but advancing openly, snarling, in leaps and bounds. Soon they'd hear its roar in the mountains to the south, one day perhaps in the hills of Provence. And by then her world would have been consumed, this perfect place reduced to rubble.<br><br>She'd been lucky in her choice of day last month when she'd ventured north to look at the battlefield. It had been a quiet day at the front. She'd persuaded old Felix to get out the carriage and the one decrepit nag they had left in the stables and drive her up to the very edge of the high country overlooking the plain with Reims at its centre. They'd found up there an ancient chapel which, unscathed so far, appeared to have enjoyed the protective sanctity of an even more ancient Celtic grove and, from its shelter, they'd stared out in silence, too shocked by what they saw to try to share their thoughts. The skylarks and wood doves had been making more of a clamour, she remembered, than the guns that day.<br><br>Framed by a canopy of beech leaves, under a hot August sky, the land of Champagne should have stretched out its smooth curves languorously, seductively, as it did in the coloured picture postcards. For nearly two thousand years it had been a bountiful vineyard. Vines planted by Roman soldiers had thrived, the land had prospered.<br><br>It had taken less than one year to bring the ordered countryside to this obscene state of devastation.<br><br>Arrogant pigs, like all armies, the Romans at least had understood the lands they had conquered; they had trodden lightly and worked hard, leaving behind fertile and civilized provinces. Unlike the present invaders. The chalky lines of their trenches tore hideous scars across the terrain, each countered by an allied trench but all advancing towards the centre where stood, blackened and fire-bombed, roofless, its towers still raising defiant fingers at the enemy, the mighty Gothic cathedral of Reims.<br><br>The trenches. Clovis was there. Not riding, lance at the port, across open country towards the enemy but, in this modern war, bogged down, hedged in, crouching in the sketchy protection of one of those scars. She'd blinked and stared at the distant battlefield swimming before her eyes. It was distorted, not by tears, but by a heat haze shimmering over the plain. She made an effort to concentrate her thoughts on her husband, to feel his discomfort. After all these months of battle, his uniform would be quite worn out. Blue captain's jacket and red trousers&#x2014;it was designed for cavalry officers peacocking about on chargers, a musical-comedy costume unsuitable for men wriggling on belly and elbows through mud and dust. And the steel helmet with horsehair plume dangling down his back&#x2014;what protection was that Napoleonic flourish against bursting shells and German snipers? In this heat the cuffs of his jacket would be chafing his wrists, his high collar would be too tight, his feet blistered.<br><br>His physical state was easily imagined but with his thoughts and emotions it was more difficult to attempt a connection. Did he raise his head and glance behind him to the hills looking towards the home he was fighting for? Were his eyes seeking the familiar outline of the grove on the hill, all unknowing, at that very moment, as she gazed down? What would he be thinking? Aline smiled. A smile soured by a dash of irony. She knew what Clovis would be thinking. He'd be calculating the number of hods per hectare this wonderful summer would produce. If there were only hands available to fetch in the harvest. If there were still grapes to be harvested. He wouldn't know.<br><br>The vineyards surrounding Reims had been destroyed in the desperate German push to the south the previous summer. For two agonizing months, von Bulow's troops had swarmed down over the Marne in an impetuous and unscheduled dash, ravaging, destroying, stealing whatever resources they could lay hands on. Aline had fled with her son before the guns sounded, obedient to Clovis's instructions. But their cellar-master and his men had stayed on guard. No command, no plea, no reasoning from Aline had been able to shake these men, elderly but stout-hearted, from their resolve to stay and guard their life's work. A deserted chateau is the first to be pillaged, they'd maintained. The best vintages had been carefully concealed behind hastily erected and plastered walls in the miles of tunnels in the chalk under the vineyard and the bottles immediately on view to a pillaging army were the less-good wines, deceptively relabelled.<br><br>And their determination had paid off. Being well beyond the protecting bulwark of the Montagne de Reims and some miles distant from the river crossings, their remote valley and the <i>vignoble</i> had escaped with the lightest of German attention. General Joffre, calculating that the enemy forces were impossibly overstretched, had reversed the retreat of the French from the north and unleashed his Fifth and Ninth Armies against the invaders. With the support of the British Expeditionary Force and the gallant dash of the French cavalry tearing into the gap between the two halves of the German army, the Boche had regretted their incursion and made off back across the Marne to the north again. They had been unequal to the task of hauling spoil from such an awkward piece of country, across a formidable river whose bridges had been blown up by the British, and the compulsion to lay greedy hands on heavy loot was more easily resisted when there were much richer pickings to be had on the accessible plain around Reims.<br><br>And now the <i>vendange</i> had come again. The second of the war. The grapes were safely in and how ironic if this year of misery and destruction were to yield a good vintage. Smaller but of a better quality perhaps than the legendary one of 1900? A daydream! Everyone said a war always began with a poor crop and ended with a good one. Nature's way of showing her disapproval of Man's activities, Aline thought, though the villagers said&#x2014;God's way. Clovis would be concerned that his estate should be running as well as could be without him. He didn't trust her to manage it. At the last moment before leaving for the war, as he'd turned to mount his horse and ride off at the head of his small squadron of cuirassiers, he'd swung on his heel, breastplate glittering, hand negligently on sword-hilt, and called her over to him. The soldier's farewell. She knew what was required of her. Suppressing the tears and tumbling endearments which would have come more naturally to her, she went to him calmly and presented her cheek for a last kiss. He had taken her by the shoulders and murmured: "Copper sulphate, my dear. Absolutely vital that you keep up supplies. Should you encounter difficulties you will have to apply to our cousin Charles."<br><br>If Clovis knew that she'd taken four days off and wasted Felix's time driving up on a fruitless expedition to gape at the battlefield where perhaps he might be fighting, he would have called her into his study and wearily delivered a ticking off. Her Parisian ways had lost much of their charm after six years of marriage, she knew that, but she could change. She was determined to change. This war would leave no one as they had been before. And, perhaps, when finally he was allowed to come home on his much overdue leave, he would notice what she'd achieved. He'd notice, approve and love her for it. Perhaps.<br><br>On leave. She'd seen him only once since this war broke out and he'd told her firmly not to expect him again until she heard that it was all over. Leave was hardly ever accorded to officers in his position. The thought of seeing him again was as alarming as it was attractive. She feared that the war would have demolished the barriers they had so carefully built between them over the years, leaving them without cover to see each other as they truly were&#x2014;or had become. Would the lubricants of convention and good manners ease them through the demands of a four-day pass? She was unsure but at their next encounter she was determined she would hold up her head and speak with pride of what she had done.<br><br>Every available person, male or female, young or old, living within ten miles of the chateau had been lured by her&#x2014;Parisian charm had its advantages on occasion&#x2014;into coming to work on the estate. The oldest recruit, Jean-Paul, rheumatic and toothless at seventy-five, had come out of retirement and found the energy to shuffle every morning along the rows in the vineyard, pruning, training and singing to the vines. The youngest recruit was her own son, five-year-old Georges, who scampered about screaming defiance and throwing stones at the invading birds.<br><br>She'd raised a squad of thirty willing but sporadically available workers. The vineyard had even had the good luck to avoid attack by the phylloxera pestilence which had ravaged production on the great estates to the north. Aline paid her workers with the little cash she could lay hands on, with eggs and milk from the home farm and with promises of a share of the wine production. Well&#x2014;why not? It was better shared out. If they had to leave it in the cellar before fleeing away again there was every chance it would be drunk by a regiment of swaggering Boches bombing and gassing their way south. And she had devised a scheme to outflank the enemy. If they could just be held at bay until the first cold snap of the winter came, stilling the fermentation, she could arrange to have some of the barrels shipped south to a cousin's estate to await maturity in a Proven�al haven. A mad notion. She could imagine his wry comment: "Not, perhaps, one of your more considered ideas, Aline." But it was the product of her resolve to preserve a vestige at least of Clovis's world. And evidence of her own achievement. She would have felt defeated if the one gap in the run of vintages for hundreds of years had occurred during her stewardship.<br><br>More practical was her plan to find out from Jean-Paul, while he still had the memory, how to take shoots, samples, cuttings&#x2014;whatever they were&#x2014;of the strongest and best of their undiseased crop and to make off with them to safety. Aline hadn't discussed these plans with Clovis. She hadn't mentioned them in her letters, fearing she might irritate and distract him from the business of war; anxious also to appear confident and capable. It would be all too easy to make a foolish remark, betraying her ignorance. He had never expected the war to go on for so long or to loom so close. Would he be pleased at her foresight or would he shake his head, pitying her innocence and wild optimism?<br><br>A third booming crash had her once again on her bicycle and pedalling fast for the ch�teau.<br><br>It lay sunning itself in sleepy elegance, ancient and lovely, its two wings extending, she always thought, with their perfect symmetry, to enfold anyone approaching in a welcoming embrace. But it seemed she wasn't the first person to be welcomed down the carriage-drive this morning. A battered old transporter lorry with army markings was sitting, cocking a rusty snook at the white marble sweep of the staircase up to the double front doors which, unusually, were standing slightly open.<br><br>And something else was wrong. She looked for Clovis's dog. When she left the ch�teau and cycled off to do her weekly stint in the military hospital the greyhound always went on watch, positioning itself with bored resignation to cascade elegantly down the top three steps. But today the familiar form was absent from its post.<br><br>Aline's heart began to race as the implications became clear. Of course, he'd been driven home on leave. She slapped away a quick tug of doubt as a more sinister reason for a military presence raised itself: he'd been killed and someone had been sent to report his death. No. That couldn't be. They always sent a telegram or a letter or even the mayor. To announce the death of someone of Clovis's standing the Prefect himself might be paraded. She propped her cycle against the wheel of the lorry and ran up the steps. She called out for the housekeeper before remembering that it was Madame Legrand's afternoon off. The hall was dim and deserted but in a distant back room a door banged and she caught a blast of hearty male laughter. A maid, pink and giggling, hurried shyly towards her, fluttering with the responsibility of taking on the housekeeper's duty.<br><br>"Madame! Oh, there you are! We've been looking out for you for ages! They've arrived! A message came to say they were on their way an hour after you'd left. The Captain said not to send after you . . . better to let you go ahead and do your duties. He could wait . . ."</p><h2>The Search for Fulfillment: Revolutionary New Research That Reveals the Secret to Long-term Happiness</h2><p>In the fall of 1966, at a university in the Northeast, 350 students signed up for a psychological survey on personal development and happiness. In 1977, Susan Krauss Whitbourne, then a young psychology professor, came across the study and decided to expand it. She tracked down the study's original participants and questioned them every decade until she had forty years' worth of data. Now, in this groundbreaking book, Whitbourne reveals the findings of this extensive project, a seminal piece of research into how people change over the course of their lifetimes. The results indicate something fascinating: No matter how old or how content you might currently feel, it is never too late to steer your life toward a greater sense of purpose and satisfaction.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Western society often paints a pessimistic view of aging, a "best years are behind you" attitude. But Whitbourne challenges this notion and posits that it's possible to find fulfillment at any age. Guided by her research, she identifies five different life pathways and provides a questionnaire that will help you discover which one you are currently on:<br>&nbsp;<br>� The Meandering Way You have a low sense of identity, lack priorities, and feel lost, unable to settle on a clear set of goals.<br>� The Downward Slope You seem to have it all, until one or two poor decisions send your life into a spiral.<br>� The Straight and Narrow Way You embrace predictability, shy away from risk, and don't enjoy shaking up your routine.<br>� The Triumphant Trail Your inner resilience has allowed you to overcome significant challenges that could have left you despondent.<br>� The Authentic Road You take a bold and honest look at your life, assess whether it's truly satisfying, and take the necessary risks to get back on track.<br>&nbsp;<br>Whitbourne shows how you can work yourself off a negative pathway and onto one that is more fulfilling. And if you identify yourself as being on one of the more positive pathways, you'll learn how to keep enhancing your feelings of satisfaction.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filled with insight and candid personal profiles of Whitbourne's subjects, <b>The Search for Fulfillment</b> offers proof that change is not only possible but ultimately rewarding. Revolutionary and inspirational, this encouraging book provides a new way of looking at our lives&#x2014;and a guidepost for making changes for the better, at any age.</p><p>Susan Krauss Whitbourne is a pioneer in the study of adult development and has been leading the field for more than thirty years. She received her doctorate in psychology from Columbia University and is currently a professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Whitbourne has been interviewed and cited in numerous articles in publications including <i>The New York Times, Newsweek, Redbook</i>, and <i>Glamour</i>. A licensed psychologist, she lives with her husband in Amherst, Massachusetts.<i>Chapter One<br>Grown-ups and Growth<br></i><br>As she sifts through the day's e-mails, Barbara pauses to admire the sparkling diamond on her ring finger, a present from William, her fourth (yes, fourth) husband. (I have changed all of the subjects' names and identifying characteristics but have otherwise stayed true to the information that I have collected about them.) She and William just celebrated their fifteenth anniversary, but Barbara still shudders to think that she burned through three previous marriages in twenty years.<br><br>Back when her college pals were in the social whirl, Barbara&#x2014;now one of the country's leading nuclear physicists&#x2014;was working furiously in the lab. By the time she was a senior, she had spent two summers training at the premier nuclear research lab in the country. But her parents couldn't understand how a pretty girl like Barbara could be interested in spending all her time in the basement of the science building.<br><br>So Barbara made her parents happy by marrying her boyfriend. He was nice enough but not her intellectual equal. And in fact he wasn't so nice when she started spending nights and weekends at school working on her graduate thesis. Once after running an experiment until three in the morning, she stumbled home to find that he had cleared out of their apartment.<br><br>Marriage number two lasted ten years and produced her two oldest children. Although she could write her first divorce off to marrying too early, or marrying just to please her parents, she couldn't figure out what exactly she did wrong in the second one. Yet, shortly after it ended, she was once again ready to try again. Marriage number three brought her a lovely boy, ten years after she thought that her motherhood days were pretty much behind her. She never imagined having four husbands, but she never imagined having three children, either.<br><br>It took three husbands to get to William, but he was worth it. A medical researcher specializing in neurodegenerative diseases, William retired a few years ago. William doesn't seem to mind Barbara's long hours, her preoccupation, her endless wondering about whether she handled a delicate situation correctly. Yes, Barbara has finally met the man who not only is her intellectual equal but who also really understands what makes her tick.<br><br>Still, Barbara is filled with self-doubts. Despite a significant record of scientific accomplishments, she's scarred from her colleagues' hostile reception of her as a pioneering female scientist. And while she appears to have it all&#x2014;a stimulating job, a beautiful home, a loving husband, and three well-adjusted children, she wonders: Why am I not happier? She knows that she's been tough to live with, and now she is beginning to see, perhaps for the first time in her life, just how tough she has been. This is probably a good realization, but it will not lead to her being able to dismiss her feelings of regret and despair.<br><br>Barbara was born with a particular temperament and abilities that blossomed in her childhood. As an adult, she made many choices that changed the course of her life and was also a victim of circumstances beyond her control. Where, then, do we begin if we want to pick apart Barbara's history to figure out how she can feel more fulfilled now?<br><br>I've put Barbara's and dozens of her fellow baby boomers' lives under the microscope, in the hope of proving or disproving the assumptions we make about what will bring us happiness, and to show whether and&#x2014; more important&#x2014;how we can change as adults. I've used the theory of Erik Erikson to guide me in my analyses, a theory that posits that adults do continue to develop well past the point of physical maturation. But these changes, Erikson believed, don't necessarily happen in a predictable lockstep fashion. Understanding how change occurs and how we can make change work to our benefit is one of the key themes in this book.<br><br><i>A Turbulent Time</i><br><br>In the film The Graduate, Dustin Hoffman's character floated aimlessly in his parents' pool after finishing college, just around the time Barbara and her classmates began participating in my study. With the Vietnam War looming as a backdrop, university campuses became the main stages upon which drastic cultural changes were getting played out. A restless and rebellious youth movement offered more choices, both good and bad, to its adherents.<br><br>Barbara was part of a surge of women students: About 12 percent of eighteen- and nineteen-year-old women attended college in 1947, compared with about 35 percent in 1970. Even in light of these new opportunities, the pressures to conform to a traditional life path were strong. To put into context Barbara's choice to marry, consider that in 1966, on average, women married at age 20.5 and men at 22.8.<br><br><i>Sex and Stagnation: Dominant Views of Development<br></i><br>Credited with discovering that the roots of personality lie deep within our unconscious, Freud, the founder of psychodynamic theory, believed that our personalities are essentially formed by the time we are five, the result of our passing through (or not passing through) sexually oriented phases&#x2014;notably the oral stage, the anal stage, and, most important, the oedipal or phallic stage. After that it was a matter of playing out the results of one's failure or success at passing through each stage. Though Freud was the founder of talk therapy, he didn't think there was much hope of changing the personalities of people older than fifty&#x2014;they were too rigidly set in their ways.<br><br>Erikson was a psychoanalyst trained by Freud's own daughter, Anna. He spent his time on the playground of the therapeutic institute she directed, watching young children play with their toys. After leaving Vienna and setting up his own shop at Harvard University, where he was to develop his own influential theory, Erikson decided that Freud had misrepresented the process of human growth and change. The more he thought about it, the more convinced Erikson became that our development is shaped by forces other than sexual ones. Just as important, Erikson couldn't envision development coming to an abrupt halt in childhood or even in puberty. That notion ?didn't fit with his own observations of the lives of his patients and the lives of the famous subjects of his biographical studies.<br><br>Although Freud's work fascinated me, and in fact triggered my decision to major in psychology, it was Erikson's work that really engaged my imagination. I was inspired by Erikson's optimism about the potential for change throughout life and by the breadth of his vision about the influences on our development, influences that go beyond sexual motives. Because I was pretty convinced myself, at the ripe old age of twenty-five, that personality continued to evolve through life, I was eager to immerse myself in his theory&#x2014;and to put it to the test.<br><br><i>Erikson's Building Blocks of Personality</i><br><br>Like Freud, Erikson conceived of personality development as a series of stages. But unlike Freud, he took into account the importance of social experiences throughout our lives. Erikson imagined that at each of these "psychosocial" stages people face a conflict between two forces. If they successfully wage the battle, they will acquire a positive psychological quality. If they lose that battle, an unfavorable outcome will occur. Whatever the result, one stage builds on the next.<br><br>To give Erikson's theory the consideration it deserves would require a book in itself, but I've done my best to summarize the psychosocial stages here. I've also, somewhat reluctantly, indicated at what age the stages are most likely to emerge. However, early stages can occur at later points and vice versa. Thinking of them as building blocks rather than stages helps keep this point in mind. The blocks can be combined and recombined in infinitely varying ways throughout our lives.<br><br>1. Trust vs. Mistrust<br><br>(typically emerges between birth and age one)<br><br>The first issue we confront in life is the need to establish a basic sense of trust, or confidence that the world is a safe place for us. If our parents are consistent caregivers, providing food, support, and protection, we resolve this issue successfully and believe that we can rely on other people to care for us in times of trouble. We are confident that the world is a benevolent place, and as we go through our day-to-day lives, we are generally in a good mood.<br><br>Jane, for example, is the president of a student theater troupe at a prestigious high school. Whether she's speaking about her husband's recent interest in Eastern religions or her students' efforts to learn a difficult play, she's full of wonder and good humor. She sincerely believes her mentoring can help the kids she works with, and always sees the best in them. Throughout her life, her personality has benefited from the solid foundation she has in her sense of trust, a strength that has allowed her to maintain faith in herself and hope for others.<br><br>The people you know who are low in the quality of trust have a fundamental sense of cynicism, and instead of looking on the bright side, they expect the worst of people. They try to take advantage of others because they believe that if they don't, others will take advantage of them first.<br><br>One of Jane's classmates, Bob, was such a person. In fact, he was the polar opposite of Jane, starting out in his college days as just about as low on trust as you could possibly be. He gradually dug himself out of this hole, but his early personality deficits continued to plague him. His choice of profession as a divorce lawyer probably fit well with this personality profile, since many of his dealings would by definition be contentious and bitter. Now he is full of regret about how he has conducted his life, but with such a deficient beginning, it is hard to imagine how it could have been otherwise.<br><br>We will look at people who span the full range on trust, from the Janes to the Bobs. We'll see how trust served as the bedrock of personality...</p><h2>Bust (Hard Case Crime)</h2><p>When Max Fisher, who is cheating on his wife, hires a psychopath to kill his wife, things go horribly wrong for everyone involved.

He also writes comics for Marvel and DC, as well as original graphic novels. He lives in New York City.<i>Starred Review.</i> This first-time collaboration between two rising crime fiction writers is a full-tilt, rocking homage to noir novels of the 1950s, taking full advantage of the neo-pulp Hard Case Crime imprint. Wealthy, successful New York City business owner Max Fisher finds himself in a delightfully familiar scenario: he wants to get rid of his nagging wife so he can shack up with his sexy secretary, Angela Petrakos. When Angela introduces Max to Dillon, a former IRA hit man, Max thinks he's found his man; what Max doesn't know is that Dillon is already Angela's man&#x2014;and the two plan to double-cross Max as soon as it becomes profitable. Dillon, however, proves to be less a professional than a psychotic: he'd just as soon kill "for the price of a pint" as he would for Max's wealth. Rolling in on the action is wheelchair-bound Bobby Rosa, an ex-con with a taste for lewd photography, guns and blackmail. As it tends to do, the murderous plot goes awry, sending Bruen and Starr's delicious, despicable characters scrambling for their money and their lives. A seamless blend of Bruen's dead-on Irish underworld and Starr's hellish vision of the Big Apple, Hard Case's latest release is smart, trashy fun, fulfilling ably the series' irresistible promise. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Civilizations&#x2014;the highest cultural groupings of people&#x2014;are differentiated from each other by religion, history, language and tradition. In the resulting era of cultural conflict that is emerging, the United States must forge alliances with similar cultures and spread its values wherever possible. In Huntington's final analysis, the West must be accommodating if possible and confrontational if necessary; moreover, all civilizations will have to learn to tolerate each other.

John James Todd&#39;s reminiscences carry us through the ups and downs of a long and lively career that begins in genteel Edinburgh, devastatingly detours out to the Western Front, forks off, after a period of cosy family life in London, to the electric excitements of the Berlin film-world of the Twenties, then moves on to Hollywood ... to ordeal by McCarthyism and eventual escape to Europe&#39; Peter Kemp, Observer.</p><p>In this extraordinary novel, William Boyd presents the autobiography of John James Todd, whose uncanny and exhilarating life as one of the most unappreciated geniuses of the twentieth century is equal parts Laurence Stern, Charles Dickens, Robertson Davies, and Saul Bellow, and a hundred percent William Boyd.<p>From his birth in 1899, Todd was doomed. Emerging from his angst-filled childhood, he rushes into the throes of the twentieth century on the Western Front during the Great War, and quickly changes his role on the battlefield from cannon fodder to cameraman. When he becomes a prisoner of war, he discovers Rousseau's Confessions, and dedicates his life to bringing the memoir to the silver screen. Plagued by bad luck and blind ambition, Todd becomes a celebrated London upstart, a Weimar luminary, and finally a disgruntled director of cowboy movies and the eleventh member of the Hollywood Ten. One of the most versatile novelists writing today, Boyd has invented a most irresistible novel.</p>William Boyd was born in 1952 in Accra, Ghana and grew up there and in Nigeria. His first novel, A Good Man in Africa (1981), won the Whitbread First Novel Award and the Somerset Maugham Prize. His other novels include An Ice Cream War (1982, shortlisted for the 1982 Booker Prize and winner of the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize), Stars and Bars (1984), The New Confessions (1987), Brazzaville Beach (1990, winner of the McVitie Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize), The Blue Afternoon (1993, winner of the 1993 Sunday Express Book of the Year Award), Armadillo (1998), Any Human Heart (2002, winner of the Prix Jean Monnet) and Restless (2006, winner of the Costa Novel of the Year Award). His latest novel is Sweet Caress (2015).

His methods are classical, his desserts extraordinary, and his flair for teaching the basic building blocks for all 100 of these delicious recipes makes every masterpiece completely achievable. From the first few chapters dealing with simpler methods, Gordon paces cooks step-by-step, expanding their range with confidence. Desserts are never mandatory, but Gordon&#39;s mission to share his passion for flavor makes these treats simply irresistible.</p><p><i>Gordon Ramsay's Just Desserts</i> is a very fine book of last courses from energetic three-star Michelin chef Gordon Ramsay, expertly marshaled for the domestic kitchen by Roz Denny. Ramsay's imagination is obviously caught by the sweet course: he expends a great deal of innovative thinking to it with fascinating results. He is inclined to roast his fruit, for example, caramelizing it for greater intensity of flavor; or he might deep-fry it, as in the elegant and fantastically nonchalant Fruit Tempura. Asian flavors appear in ethereal dishes like the Thai Rice Pudding with Coconut and Lemon or Banana and Passion Fruit Sorbet. Cheesecake is light and flavored with pumpkin. Proper homage is paid to comfort food, with recipes for Bread and Butter Pudding (Ramsay makes his with a baguette and laces it with Baileys Irish Cream) and Steamed Toffee, Banana, and Pecan Pudding. The chocolate recipes are particularly fine, with a Chocolate Mocha Tart standing out. <i>Just Desserts</i> is also an excellent primer of patisserie techniques; its explanations and illustrations of the standard syrups, pastes, sponges, and pastries of the restaurant kitchen, here translated into domestic terms, are particularly lucid. The professional mysteries of the mousse, the parfait, the bavarois, and the various manifestations of the meringue are made wonderfully clear. <i>--Robin Davidson, Amazon.co.uk</i>Gordon Ramsay has earned an extraordinary 12 Michelin stars for his restaurants in London and New York.

Service: Best Tales Of The Yukon</h2><p>In 1904, the Canadian Bank of Commerce transferred teller Robert W. Service to the Yukon Territory. Soon, he was famous as the poet who chronicled the Klondike gold rush and the savage beauty of the frozen north. His tales of hard-bitten propectors and sourdoughs in &#34;The Land God Forgot&#34; make vivid, exciting reading. Here are all the brawling, colorful characters that Service immortalized, including One-Eyed Mike, Dangerous Dan McGrew, Pious Pete, Blasphemous Bill -- and, of course, the lady known as Lou.</p><p>Robert William Service (1874&#x2013;1958) was a poet and writer, sometimes referred to as "the Bard of the Yukon". He is best-known for his writings on the Canadian North, including the poems "The Shooting of Dan McGrew", "The Law of the Yukon", and "The Cremation of Sam McGee". His writing was so expressive that his readers took him for a hard-bitten old Klondike prospector, not the later-arriving bank clerk he actually was. In addition to his Yukon works, Service also wrote poetry set in locales as diverse as South Africa, Afghanistan, and New Zealand.

Enduring cruel poverty, Phoolan Devi survived the humiliation of an abusive marriage, the savage killing of her bandit-lover and horrifying gang rape to claim retribution for herself and all low-caste women of the Indian plains. In a three-year campaign that rocked the government, she delivered justice to rape victims and stole from the rich to give to the poor, before negotiating surrender on her own terms. Throughout her years of imprisonment without trial, Phoolan Devi remained a beacon of hope for the poor and the downtrodden. In 1996, amidst both popular support and media controversy, she was elected to the Parliament.<br>On July 25th, 2001, Phoolan Devi was shot dead in Delhi. The identity of her killers is unknown, but it is thought that they may include relatives of villagers killed by her gang nearly twenty years ago. For over a decade millions have found the power and scope of Phoolan Devi's myth irresistible.

With a child's keen sense of fairness, Phoolan cried to see her father wronged, but her tears invoked only contempt and this in turn fired her rage. Instead of meekly going to the well with the other girls, she pleaded before the village elders; she grew into a nuisance, a troublemaker said her uncle. To get her out of the way, he had her married off soon after her eleventh birthday, a common enough fate for pre-adolescent girls in rural India. But Phoolan was not meek like them; she fled her husband--a fat, middle-aged man who kept his child-bride in a dark hut--and returned to her village, only to be treated as a pariah, a loose woman. Her anger wouldn't abate, and her protests at the shame the village heaped upon her became increasingly irksome to the villagers. Finally, her uncle paid to have her abducted by a gang of local bandits to dispose of as they pleased. She was only saved from death when one of the members of the gang fell in love with her."<br></p><h2>Civil Wars: A History in Ideas</h2><p>From the Balkans to Rwanda, Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan, and most recently Syria, civil conflict has exploded across the globe. In the West, politics itself looks ever more like civil war by other means. At such a charged time, David Armitage&#x2019;s unique perspective on the origins and dynamics of this phenomenon is indispensable. His highly original history traces this least understood and most intractable form of organized human aggression from ancient Rome through the centuries to the present day.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ideas of what civil war is, and what it isn&#x2019;t, have a long and contested history. Defining the term is an acutely political act: whether a war is&nbsp;&#x201c;civil&#x201d; often depends on whether one is a ruler or a rebel, victor or vanquished, participant or foreigner. Likewise, calling any particular conflict a civil war can shape its outcome by determining whether other nations choose to get involved or stand aside. This is true of many conflicts: from the American Revolution (commonly referred to as a civil war as it was waged) to the U.S. Civil War to the Second Gulf War. In each, pivotal decisions by outside powers turned on precisely such shifts of perspective.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In <i>Civil Wars</i>, eminent historian David Armitage offers invaluable illumination. By touching on significant developments in Western thought&#x2014;the poetry of Lucan, the political theory of Thomas Hobbes, the so-called Lieber Code produced during the U.S. Civil War, to name a few&#x2014;he creates a &#x201c;genealogy&#x201d; of our sometimes contradictory notions about civil war. The result reveals much about how this intellectual inheritance has shaped the political fortunes of our uneasy world and how we might think about this form of violence in the future.</p><p>DAVID ARMITAGE is the Lloyd C. Blankfein Professor of History and Chair of the Department of History at Harvard University, where he teaches intellectual history and international history. He is also an Affiliated Professor in the Harvard Department of Government, an Affiliated Faculty Member at Harvard Law School, and an Honorary Professor of History at the University of Sydney. He has written or edited fourteen previous books. The author lives in Massachusetts, USA.War is hell, the U.S. Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman is supposed to have said, but surely the only thing worse is <i>civil </i>war. On that fact, there has been general agreement across the centuries. Internal wars are felt to be more destructive than ones against external enemies.&nbsp;Writing in the wake of Rome&#x2019;s civil wars, in the first century B.C.E., the poet Lucan concluded from the shattered cities, abandoned fields, and droves of the dispossessed, &#x201c;No foreign sword has ever penetrated / so: it is wounds inflicted by the hand of fellow-citizen that have sunk deep.&#x201d; Civil wars are like a sickness of the body politic, destroying it from within. Likewise, the Renaissance essayist Michel de Montaigne would warn his readers during the French Wars of Religion, &#x201c;In truth <i>a forraine warre is nothing so dangerous a disease as a civill.</i>&#x201d; Dangerous and morally degrading, too. Just before the Irish Civil War of 1922, an elderly priest lamented, &#x201c;War with the foreigner brings to the fore all that is best and noblest in a nation&#x2014;civil war all that is mean and base.&#x201d; And even when the battles have ceased, they leave wounds that will not heal: &#x201c;I question whether any serious civil war ever does end,&#x201d;&nbsp;T. S. Eliot observed in 1947. On a visit to Spain in 1970,&nbsp;the former French president Charles de Gaulle agreed: &#x201c;All wars are bad . . . But civil wars, in which there are brothers in both trenches, are unforgivable, because peace is not born when war concludes.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Civil wars are doubtless inhumane but they have been so widespread and persistent that some have suspected them of being essential to our humanity. As Hans-Magnus Enzensberger argued, &#x201c;Animals fight, but they don&#x2019;t wage war. Only man&#x2014;unique among the primates&#x2014;practises the large-scale, deliberate and enthusiastic destruction of his fellow creatures.&#x201d; And what could be more characteristically human, yet more shamefully different from the habits of other animals, than inflicting aggression on your immediate neighbors? Formal warfare, conducted by professional armies and constrained by the laws of war, was something modern and recent, but what lay behind the outward show was a more basic, more enduring, form of inhumanity: <i>civil war. </i>&#x201c;Civil war is not merely an old custom,&#x201d; Enzensberger concluded, &#x201c;but the primary form of all collective conflict.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Psychology of Self-Esteem</h2><p>Dr. Branden has created a series of lectures which substantially updates and expands upon the materials in &#34;The Psycology of Self-Esteem, Breaking Free,&#34; and &#34;The Disowned Self.&#34; Here are some of the highlights of this comprehensive presentation of Biocentric Psycology: The need, the motivating power of self-esteem, its relationship to love, work, and personal relationships, man-woman relationships, emotions, disowning the self, alienation, anxiety, depression, and more. 30 audio CDs (26 hrs.)

No wonder his amigos--Iguana, Conejo, and Culebra--are following him. But they aren&#39;t the only ones after the tortoise. Coyote has his own dinner plans for Tortuga and his grandmother. Can the three amigos warn them in time,in this variation of Little Red Riding Hood? A companion to &#34;Manana, Iguana&#34;; &#34;Fiesta Fiasco&#34;; and &#34;Count on Culebra&#34;.</p><p>Ann Whitford Paul was a social worker before becoming a writer.

She lives in southern California.Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2014;A revamped version of "Little Red Riding Hood." As Tortuga (turtle) slowly makes his way to his <i>abuela's</i> house, his friends Conejo (rabbit), Culebra (snake), and Iguana follow behind, hoping to get a taste of the goodies in the basket. When he encounters Coyote, foolish Tortuga doesn't see any harm in talking to him despite his decidedly hungry appearance. Upon his arrival at his <i>abuela's</i>, Tortuga notices what big <i>orejas, ojos</i>, and <i>dientes</i> she has. When discovered, Coyote wastes no time in locking him in a closet with his grandmother. As the water boils for Tortuga soup, the three friends make a horrific sound outside using their feet, tail, and rattle. Convinced that monsters are after him, Coyote runs into the desert, and grateful Tortuga shares the supper he has brought with his <i>amigos</i>. This fun tale has a nice combination of Spanish and English words. Meaning is usually clear from context, but a helpful glossary is included. Long uses a lot of yellow, orange, and green, giving his illustrations an appropriately Southwestern look. The <i>amigos</i> are all amusingly drawn with big eyes and great expressions. The depiction of Coyote is quite scary with his pointed yellow teeth and hungry eyes. This fresh look on an old classic is sure to be a hit with children.&#x2014;<i>Catherine Callegari, Gay-Kimball Library, Troy, NH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Curmudgeonly journalist Ambrose Bierce and his young sidekick, Tom Redmond, look into the shooting death of popular preacher and notorious ladies' man Henry Devine. A second murder follows, of banker William P. Jaspers, whose wife was a devotee of the Reverend Devine. In between interviewing jealous husbands and trying to locate possibly vengeful offspring, Tom pursues his free-love-advocating cousin Amanda Wilson with mixed success, while Bierce exchanges barbs with novelist Gertrude Atherton and otherwise comments cynically on the proceedings. During one interlude, the author of The Devil's Dictionary cites approvingly examples of Ulysses S. Grant's direct and vigorous prose. Hall's spare, laconic style is of comparable quality. Despite a contrived denouement that allows Redmond to perform some stagy heroics during a suffragist parade and a remote killer who remains little more than a set of motivations, Hall delivers an ingenious twist at the end, with subtle hints along the way, that should catch most readers by surprise.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The author starts with an overview of each continent, highlighting special details about it, such as the highest peak and the largest city. Then, countries or regions within it are broken down for further study. The arrangement may lead to confusion for readers new to geography. For example, South America is divided into North Andean South America, Eastern South America, and South Andean South America. A table lists the area, population, and number of countries for each continent. The area, population, language, type of government, and currency for individual countries is similarly displayed. Children can learn about food, wildlife, historic places, sports, music, people groups, arts, architecture, and many other topics of interest. The writing can be a bit dry and generalized at times. The author writes about Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait, "These three countries all have vast deserts with large oil deposits." There are errors, such as "England, Scotland, and Whales [sic] make up Great Britain." (Wales is spelled correctly on the map.) Two of the country maps use a star to designate the capital cities, but Scotland's capital garners only a dot. Watercolor illustrations and hand-drawn maps featuring bodies of water, mountain ranges, and capital cities are scattered throughout. They are simplistic in style and coloring, with sparse detail. A full-color compendium of flags of the world, a general index, and a country index are appended. This is a serviceable title for browsing, but it is not an essential purchase.&#x2014;<i>DeAnn Okamura, San Mateo County Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Eisenhower, 1961-1969</h2><p>When President Dwight Eisenhower left Washington, D.C., at the end of his second term, he retired to a farm in historic Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, that he had bought a decade earlier. Living on the farm with the former president and his wife, Mamie, were his son, daughter-in-law, and four grandchildren, the oldest of whom, David, was just entering his teens. In this engaging and fascinating memoir, David Eisenhower&#x2014;whose previous book about his grandfather, <i>Eisenhower at War, 1943&#x2013;1945, </i>was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize&#x2014;provides a uniquely intimate account of the final years of the former president and general, one of the giants of the twentieth century. <br><br>In <i>Going Home to Glory, </i>Dwight Eisenhower emerges as both a beloved and forbidding figure. He was eager to advise, instruct, and assist his young grandson, but as a general of the army and president, he held to the highest imaginable standards. At the same time, Eisenhower was trying to define a new political role for himself. Ostensibly the leader of the Republican party, he was prepared to counsel his successor, John F. Kennedy, who sought instead to break with Eisenhower&#x2019;s policies. (In contrast, Kennedy&#x2019;s successor, Lyndon Johnson, would eagerly seek Eisenhower&#x2019;s advice.) As the tumultuous 1960s dawned, with assassinations, riots, and the deeply divisive war in Vietnam, plus a Republican nominee for president in 1964 whom Eisenhower considered unqualified, the former president tried to chart the correct course for himself, his party, and the country. Meanwhile, the past continued to pull on him as he wrote his memoirs, and publishers and broadcasters asked him to reminisce about his wartime experiences. <br><br>When his grandfather took him on a post-presidential tour of Europe, David saw firsthand the esteem with which monarchs, prime ministers, and the people of Europe held the wartime hero. Then as later, David was under the watchful eye of a grandfather who had little understanding of or patience with the emerging rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll generation. But even as David went off to boarding school and college, grandfather and grandson remained close, visiting and corresponding frequently. David and Julie Nixon&#x2019;s romance brought the two families together, and Eisenhower strongly endorsed his former vice-president&#x2019;s successful run for the presidency in 1968. <br><br>With a grandson&#x2019;s love and devotion but with a historian&#x2019;s candor and insight, David Eisenhower has written a remarkable book about the final years of a great American whose stature continues to grow.</p><p>David Eisenhower is the Director of the Institute for Public Service at the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of <i>Eisenhower at War: 1943-1945</i>, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in history in 1987. Educated at Philips Exeter Academy, Amherst College, and George Washington University Law School, he is the son of John and Barbara Eisenhower, and the grandson of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He is married to the former Julie Nixon, younger daughter of President Richard Nixon. David and Julie Eisenhower are the parents of three adult children and live in suburban Philadelphia.<br><br>Julie Nixon Eisenhower is the author of two previous books, <i>Special People</i> and <i>Pat Nixon: The Untold Story</i>.&nbsp;Going Home to Glory 1<p></p> <br><br> GETTYSBURG<p></p> <br>GOING HOME<br> <br>In the late afternoon of Inauguration Day, January 20, 1961, Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower drove north to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in the 1955 Chrysler Imperial that Mamie had purchased for Ike on his sixty-fifth birthday. The outgoing President and First Lady, their personal servants, Sergeant John Moaney and Rosie Woods, and chauffeur, Leonard Dry, sat together in the roomy car. There was an eerie loneliness about the absence of motorcycle escorts and caravans of Secret Service and press cars. A single Secret Service vehicle with driver and agent led the Chrysler. When the Eisenhowers approached the entrance to their Gettysburg farm, the Secret Service honked the horn and made a U-turn, heading back to Washington.<br> <br>The Eisenhowers&#x2019; itinerary had been published in newspapers. Despite a blizzard the night before and below-freezing temperatures, friendly groups in twos and threes lined the road between Washington and Frederick, Maryland. Near Emmitsburg, on Route 15, the crowds grew larger. The nuns, priests, and students of Mount St. Mary&#x2019;s and St. Joseph&#x2019;s colleges, bundled in overcoats and scarves, congregated along the road bearing &#x201c;Welcome Home&#x201d; signs.<br> <br>In Gettysburg, a festive mood reigned. Over sixty civic organizations prepared for celebrations scheduled the following evening in the town square welcoming the Eisenhowers home as private citizens. Henry Scharf, owner of the Gettysburg Hotel and host of the &#x201c;Welcome Home Day&#x201d; celebration, was pleased that Eisenhower had selected Gettysburg to retire. The Eisenhowers would not only mean tourism, but also add to the historical stature of the community. Scharf, like the majority of the townspeople, had a sense of history about Gettysburg. His study at home was packed with books on the Civil War, World War II, and the American Revolution. By the untidy appearance of his study, one judged he used those references constantly, and he did. He was convinced Eisenhower&#x2019;s decision to retire to Gettysburg was an affirmation of the town&#x2019;s historical uniqueness.<br> <br>As Scharf said to his wife, Peggy, &#x201c;This is the greatest thing to happen to this town since the battle. This man is beloved by everyone, including his opponents. He is the best-loved president since Lincoln.&#x201d;<br> <br>But there was a difference. While in office, Lincoln had been one of the most maligned presidents in American history. His stature had grown with the passage of time and he was linked to Gettysburg by his unforgettable address at the dedication of the National Cemetery. Eisenhower, on the other hand, was perhaps the most popular president while in office, but his reputation might not grow like Lincoln&#x2019;s, might in fact diminish.<br> <br>Earlier that morning, Scharf&#x2019;s daughter, Elise, scurried about her Alexandria, Virginia, apartment collecting a few necessities for the journey to Gettysburg along the precise route the Eisenhower party would take. Not only was Elise needed at home to assist with the multicourse dinner arrangements; she also eagerly anticipated a chance to see the Eisenhowers close-up and perhaps even to chat. Elise admired President Eisenhower and had seen him from a distance on the few occasions her father&#x2019;s staff had been involved in catering functions on the grounds of the Gettysburg farm. She had gone along as a member of the kitchen or grounds crew, just for a glimpse. Now, as far as she and several thousand other Gettysburgians were concerned, the Eisenhowers were becoming neighbors. Nobody planned to bother them or to ask them to appear at social gatherings and club functions. Everyone expected that eventually the Eisenhowers would take some active part in the community, but no one would impose.<br> <br>The weather was ominous. Elise worried that she would be blocked by the accumulating snowdrifts, which were paralyzing the capital city and the roads leading to southern Pennsylvania. Snow had fallen heavily the night before, and the entire Potomac Basin was frozen. Temperatures had plummeted. As the ceremonies inaugurating John Kennedy as the thirty-fifth president drew to a conclusion, Elise called the Maryland State Police to learn the status of the northbound roads. She found out that nothing could be guaranteed after three o&#x2019;clock but that if she left immediately, she had a reasonable chance of getting home.<br> <br>Additionally, she reasoned, if she could reach Route 15 at Frederick, the remainder of the road running through Thurmont and Emmitsburg would be kept open for the Eisenhower motorcade. Elise set off on her uncertain trek and eventually joined up five minutes behind the bittersweet Eisenhower procession.<br> <br>Every mile, Elise saw evidence that the Eisenhower motorcade had passed through minutes before. She saw discarded signs reading &#x201c;Welcome Home,&#x201d; and the dispersing throngs who moments earlier had braved the cold to ease Eisenhower&#x2019;s transition to private life. In Emmitsburg, Peggy passed the congregation of nuns packing up blankets and signs outside of St. Joseph&#x2019;s College. Upon arriving in Gettysburg, she learned of improving forecasts for the 21st, calling for frigid weather but gradually diminishing snowfall. The ceremonies set for the next day were on.<br> <br><br> <br>At dinnertime, my grandparents drove directly to our home, a former schoolhouse that stood on the corner of their farm. My three younger sisters, Anne, eleven, Susan, nine, Mary Jean, five, and I, now a grown-up twelve years old, had watched the inauguration at home in Gettysburg. I remembered thinking that it should have been the Nixons moving into the White House&#x2014;and then thinking that being twelve and fourteen years old, the ages of Julie and Tricia Nixon, would be a terrible time to have Secret Service agents. I would miss the men on my detail, but not their constant guarding of Gran One, Gran Two, Gran Three, and Gran Four, the official Secret Service names for my sisters and me.<br> <br>Everyone now seemed animated and happy, in sharp contrast to the air of numbing tension in the White House several weeks earlier. Relaxed, Granddad listened intently to every word spoken and seemed to say less than usual. He basked in the attention, joking lightly. Characteristically, he wandered frequently into the kitchen to supervise dinner preparations by Sergeant Moaney and his wife, Delores, who had arrived at the farm earlier in the day. Moaney had joined Granddad&#x2019;s staff as his orderly in the early months of the war in Europe and Delores had become my grandparents&#x2019; cook after the war.<br> <br>My father, John, broke the spell of gaiety toward the end of the evening, standing up from the dinner table to speak. He reviewed briefly Granddad&#x2019;s accomplishments and then spoke of the years before the fame. As a small, tight-knit family of three, the Eisenhowers had seen much of the world. They had lived in Paris and in Washington both before and during the Depression. They then went on to the Philippines and four years of service under General Douglas MacArthur. The war had dispersed the family, John going to West Point, Mamie returning to Washington, and Dwight Eisenhower going on, in Douglas MacArthur&#x2019;s words, to &#x201c;write his name in history.&#x201d; Dad recalled that the decision to run for president had been difficult, but in the end, Dwight Eisenhower had returned from his NATO command to lead the country through eight years of peace and prosperity. Dad spoke of the experience of a lifetime he had had serving his father in the West Wing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Leaving the White House will not be easy at first,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;But we are reunited as a family, and this&#x201d;&#x2014;Dad gestured to all of us seated, and outside toward the farm&#x2014;&#x201c;is what we have wanted. I suppose that tonight, we welcome back a member of this clan who has done us proud.&#x201d; Dad raised his glass in a toast.<br> <br>Too moved to reply, Granddad simply held his glass high and joined in the &#x201c;hear, hear.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>It had been a long day. Earlier, Eisenhower had transferred power to John F. Kennedy. That morning, after coffee at the White House and a brief pause at the North Portico for the benefit of newsmen, photographers, and television cameras, Eisenhower and Kennedy had driven off to the Capitol wearing top hats in place of the homburgs that Eisenhower had sought to install as a tradition at his inaugural in 1953. The tradition, Time noted, &#x201c;will end with his [Eisenhower&#x2019;s] administration.&#x201d;<br> <br>Slowly the black limousine bearing the oldest and second-youngest presidents in U.S. history had rolled toward the gleaming Capitol building, past the crowd estimated at nearly a million people lining Washington&#x2019;s broad boulevards and gradually filling the newly installed tiers of spectator&#x2019;s stands. In December, Eisenhower had ruefully likened the stands appearing around the White House and along the inaugural parade route to &#x201c;scaffolds.&#x201d; By that comment Eisenhower might have been mindful of his inauguration eight years earlier. After he and Harry Truman exchanged only a few words during the entire ceremony, Truman&#x2019;s departure, in Eisenhower&#x2019;s mind, had taken on the character of a hanging. But in January 1961, Harry Truman, busy making the rounds of inaugural parties, appeared to have forgotten the affair. On the 19th, Truman told reporters he had &#x201c;no advice&#x201d; regarding Eisenhower&#x2019;s retirement, adding that as far as he was concerned, Eisenhower was &#x201c;a very nice person.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eisenhower was being handled gently, even affectionately, as he went through the ritual of laying down power. Since November, Kennedy had been at his cordial best. Before the inaugural ceremony, Eisenhower and Kennedy had chatted amicably in the Red Room. For his part, Kennedy was almost alight with the intense media excitement over his ascension to power.<br> <br>Eisenhower had been busy in January preparing his final messages to the American people. In his eighth State of the Union address, he declared the state of the union to be sound. He reminded the country that for eight years Americans had &#x201c;lived in peace.&#x201d; Eisenhower listed his administration&#x2019;s measures that had ensured the peace: the ballistic missile program, strong support for foreign aid, a series of alliances ringing the Sino-Soviet landmass, and efforts to open talks between East and West. Two weeks later, in his farewell address to the nation, Eisenhower had expressed forebodings about the domestic implications of a permanent state of mobilization without war, warning that a &#x201c;military industrial complex&#x201d; could undermine democratic self-rule.<br> <br>But Eisenhower&#x2019;s message fell on deaf ears. The inaugural coincided with a period of turmoil. Nikita Khrushchev in early January issued an ominous declaration. Aimed partly at China, partly at the United States, he endorsed &#x201c;wars of national liberation,&#x201d; a program of Soviet support for insurgencies and sabotage worldwide against the remnants of Western colonialism. In Laos, North Vietnamese battalions operated with Pathet Lao units in a battle against pro-Western forces for control of the strategic Plain of Jars. In Cuba, Fidel Castro paraded Soviet-built tanks and Cuban militiamen through downtown Havana, proclaiming his preparedness against a rumored invasion from the north. In France, voters approved a referendum endorsing Charles de Gaulle&#x2019;s program to end the war in Algeria, setting the stage for France&#x2019;s capitulation to the rebel forces. Throughout Belgium, half a million workers, teachers, and businessmen protested the government&#x2019;s austerity program, enacted because of the wrenching loss of the Congo and the end of colonialism in Africa.<br> <br>Kennedy disagreed with Eisenhower&#x2019;s optimism about the state of the union and now it was his turn to speak. In January, the president-elect had proclaimed before the Massachusetts legislature that his government would &#x201c;always consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill&#x2014;the eyes of all the people are upon us.&#x201d; Now center stage, on the threshold of assuming the presidency, Kennedy wanted to convey a sense of urgency, to &#x201c;rekindle the spirit of the American revolution,&#x201d; and to ask for greater exertions by the American people. In New York on September 14, he had declared his presidency would be &#x201c;a hazardous experience,&#x201d; predicting, &#x201c;We will live on the edge of danger.&#x201d;<br> <br>Minor mishaps enriched the pageantry of the Kennedy inaugural. Cardinal Cushing&#x2019;s invocation was interrupted by a short circuit in the electric motor powering the heating system that warmed the seated dignitaries. Mamie Eisenhower first noticed the smoke and for several awkward moments the assembled officials on the platform scurried about in confusion. The winter sun&#x2019;s glare temporarily blinded poet Robert Frost at the lectern, and forced him to recite from memory a poem he had published in 1942 titled &#x201c;The Gift Outright,&#x201d; rather than the poem he had written for the inaugural.<br> <br>Following the administration of the oath, Kennedy delivered the most memorable inaugural speech since Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x2019;s in 1933. The young president achieved eloquence, an inspirational quality, a tone of defiance and resolve. He repudiated the confident premise of the Eisenhower administration. &#x201c;Only a few generations,&#x201d; he declared, &#x201c;have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I welcome this responsibility.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kennedy drew attention to his youth and to his awareness that this was a moment of transition from wartime to postwar leadership.<br> <br>We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch is passed to a new generation of Americans&#x2014;born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage&#x2014;and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today, at home and around the world.<br> <br>To Khrushchev&#x2019;s promise to subsidize &#x201c;wars of national liberation,&#x201d; Kennedy replied:<br> <br>Let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend or oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty. This much we pledge and more.<br> <br>Implying years of inaction under Eisenhower, he cried: &#x201c;But let us begin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. let us begin anew.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Los Angeles Times noted about Kennedy: &#x201c;He is wrong in implying the beginning came with him, but he is right in suggesting that the perfecting of mankind is tedious and unpredictable.&#x201d; But Time magazine had applauded Kennedy&#x2019;s &#x201c;lean, lucid phrases,&#x201d; noting his message had &#x201c;profound meaning for the US future.&#x201d;<br> <br>Fourteen years later, author Robert Nisbet, criticizing the liberals&#x2019; fondness for crisis, wrote that &#x201c;crisis is always an opportunity for a break with the despised present, liberation from the kinds of authority which are most repugnant to bold, creative and utopian minds.&#x201d; Kennedy was now president. The &#x201c;despised present&#x201d; was the Eisenhower administration and the &#x201c;liberation&#x201d; from constraints had been accomplished by the inaugural ceremony.<br> <br>Naturally, feelin...</p><h2>Northern Mists</h2><p>8vo. 204 pp, I.

He graduated from the University of Oregon and later studied at Stanford with Wallace Stegner, Malcolm Cowley, Richard Scowcroft, and Frank O' Connor. <b>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</b>, his first novel, was published in 1962. His second novel, <b>Sometimes a Great Notion</b>, followed in 1964. His other books include <b>Kesey's Garage Sale</b>, <b>Demon Box</b>, <b>Caverns</b> (with O. U. Levon), <b>The Further Inquiry</b>, <b>Sailor Song</b>, and <b>Last Go Round</b> (with Ken Babbs). His two children's books are <b>Little Tricker the Squirrel Meets Big Double the Bear</b> and <b>The Sea Lion</b>. Ken Kesey died on November 10, 2001."As in&nbsp;<i>Cuckoo's Nest</i>, Kesey brings to life people you will never forget . . . Getting into this book is getting into a fascinating, crazy world of a fascinating, crazy family which has a throbbing reality and a desperate dedication to living . . . and then there is that great gift for comedy, for purely sensational writing. When Kesey describes the Canada honkers flying over the woods you can almost see them; when he describes the smells of the grass and the tastes of the strawberries you feel and you smell and you taste."<br><b>--Ralph J. Gleason,&nbsp;<i>San Francisco Chronicle &nbsp;</i></b><br><br>"<i>Sometimes a Great Notion</i>, a big book in every way, captures the tenor of the post-Korea America as nothing I can remember reading . . . Beyond the PTA and the beer commercials, beyond the huge effluvium of the times, exist people who live by the ancient passions, and Mr. Kesey in the fullness of his material discovers them for us."<br><b>--<i>The New York Times Book Review&nbsp;</i></b><br><br>"A tremendous achievement . . . Set against the damp and brutal background of an Oregon logging community, the book by turns gasps, pants, whoops, and shrieks . . . you cannot help but admire Kesey's vigor, his profligate command of the language.

Indeed, freelance journalist Vollers spends the first third of the book leading up to Evers's murder, sketching his background and that of racist killer Byron De La Beckwith, as well as their state's racial climate. She then recounts the two mistrials in the case, the paths of Beckwith and widow Myrlie Evers and the evolution in Mississippi?a new breed of politicians, greater black political power and a more aggressive press?that set the stage for a new trial. A few passages jolt: Beckwith, during his last trial in 1994, deems a dark-skinned Indian motel manager "really a white man." Others resonate, as Vollers relates the patriotic Evers's earnest call for desegregation. Though somewhat broader in scope, this title is more diffuse and not as well written as Adam Nossiter's 1994 book, After Long Memory: Mississippi and the Murder of Medgar Evers. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.There are many "ghosts" in Mississippi, and Vollers uses every available resource to uncover them. Vollers fastens on the three-decade-old slaying of Medgar Evers, civil rights activist, and the three subsequent trials of the accused, Byron De La Beckwith, to stir up Mississippi's ghost. Her narrative and in-depth analysis of the events surrounding the trials are compelling: the interviews with those closely associated with the trials add credence to the presentation of the facts; the discussion of the relationships between civil rights and white supremacy organizations deepens understanding of the future association of these groups; and the critical analysis of the best and the worst of the Old and the New South seems well taken. Vollers does a superb job of examining the issues of civil rights, racism, and murder, and the effects of the murder of civil rights activists on the families of the victim and the murderers. In light of the recent announcement of Myrlie Evers' accession to NAACP board president, many will be interested in the Evers' family history. <i>Lillian Lewis</i></p><h2>The Bowl Is Already Broken: A Novel</h2><p><b>A big, rewarding novel about art, politics, family, terrorism, courage, and happiness.</b><br><br>Promise Whittaker, the diminutive but decisive acting director of the National Museum of Asian Art, is pregnant again--and that's just the beginning of her difficulties. Her mentor, the previous director, suddenly walked away from his job with no explanation, and now is on a dig somewhere in the Taklamakan desert. Her favorite curator has dropped their newest treasure, a bowl once owned by Thomas Jefferson, during the ceremony celebrating its acquisition. Another colleague, desperate for a son, has been embezzling from the museum to pay for her fertility treatments. And her far too handsome, far too elusive ancillary director is clearly up to no good. <br> Confronting challenge after challenge at work and at home, Promise is one of the most offbeat, original, winning characters in recent fiction. <i>The Bowl Is Already Broken</i> is all brains, all soul, and all heart--brimming with ideas, provocative, and deeply satisfying.<br></p><p><b>Mary Kay Zuravleff </b>is the author of <i>The Frequency of Souls </i>(FSG, 1996). A former editor of books and exhibition texts for the Smithsonian Institution, she lives in Washington, D.C., with her family.<br>Former <i>Smithsonian</i> editor Zuravleff's logy second novel (after <i>The Frequency of Souls</i>) tracks the mishaps and hard-won triumphs of the staff of a little museum that could, Washington, D.C.'s fictitious Museum of Asian Art. The novel opens on diminutive Promise Whittaker, the acting director, watching the museum's curator of Chinese ceramics drop a priceless Jingdezhen porcelain bowl at the prize acquisition's unveiling ceremony. Backtrack six months: Promise, a 43-year-old, Oklahoma-bred Rumi scholar and devoted wife and mother of two, is as floored by her promotion to interim director as she is by her unexpected pregnancy. Then director Joseph Lattimore, yearning to join a dig in the Taklamakan Desert, is threatened with the museum's extinction unless he brings in significant funding. Meanwhile, the curator of ancient Chinese art, Min Chen, embezzles museum funds to cover fertility treatments. As Joseph is eased into involuntary retirement, Promise injects some much needed energy into the museum's operations, all while maintaining an implausibly ideal home life. Though the plot ranges from shenanigans in D.C. to adventures in Central Asia, it bogs down in art historical detail where it should skip briskly. The shattered bowl becomes a metaphor of Buddhist wisdom, a lesson in patience and fortitude that one can also learn from tireless mothers like Promise. <i>(Apr.)</i></p><h2>Good Mourning California</h2><p>Looks at the history of California, shares the author&#39;s impressions of California in text and art, and discusses the state&#39;s gardens and landscapes</p><p>Seventeenth-century European explorers imagined California to be an island; in Solomon's view, the Golden State today is an oasis of myths and illusions. Spliced together with her own images of highways, the Marlboro Man, painted maps, conceptualist doodles and photomontages, her reflective free-form essay presents the California dream as a triumph of the synthetic, a narcissistic haven where "everyone writes their own myths," where originality is passe and "freedom is being free to conform." A California artist and architect, Solomon ( Green Architecture and the Agrarian Garden ) here provides a social topology of gardens, from San Franciscans' backyard vegetable patches to the golf-course-sized lawns of conservative Republicans. She examines the racist and jingoist underpinnings of westward-moving Americans' myth of Manifest Destiny, then looks at California's new wave of Asian and Latino immigrants, squeezed in a state where "poverty has always been a sin." A disturbing, provocative collage. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Escape (Choose Your Own Adventure #20)</h2><p>The reader decides the course of the action in the story of a spy&#39;s struggle to escape from an enemy country</p><p>R.A.

The Thames glistened in the early-morning sun. The shops and main street were quiet: it was just before six a.m. Danny Fowler pedaled past the Richmond Hotel, eager to reach the sloping road and freewheel down the hill. He had only three newspapers left to deliver. With his usual finesse, he zigzagged across the street and mounted the pavement, pausing as he folded a <i>Times</i> and a <i>Daily Mail</i> before propping his bike against the wall and hurrying over to the houses that faced the river. Just a <i>Daily Telegraph</i> to go, and then his round was finished; he couldn't wait to get back home for his breakfast. As he returned to his bicycle, stomach rumbling, a white shape caught his eye. Unsure what it was exactly, he swung his leg back over the crossbar and scooted across the road to look down the sloping bank.</p><p>It looked like a mannequin or a blow-up doll. Its arms were raised above its head, as if waving for attention, and its legs were spread-eagled. There was something strange about the way it was positioned that Danny couldn't make out from this distance, so he pedaled down the narrow lane that led to the river for a closer look.</p><p>What Danny found would stay with him for the rest of his life. He ran screaming, leaving his bike where it had fallen. The woman's naked body had been severed in two at the waist. Her dark auburn hair spread out behind her; her skin so white, it looked completely bloodless. Her face was bloated and the corners of her mouth had been slashed, giving her a clown's grimacing smile.</p><p></p><p>Detective Inspector Anna Travis arrived at the Richmond Hotel to join the murder team that had taken over the car park. She hurried over to Detective Chief Inspector Glen Morgan, who was standing by the police catering truck, Teapot One, with a cup of tea in his hand.</p><p>"Get yourself a hot drink and then we'll be going over to the tent. And brace yourself: it's not a pretty sight."</p><p>Anna ordered a coffee as the rest of the team huddled in a group around Morgan.</p><p>"Paperboy found her this morning. Came in with his mother; he's given us a statement. I let him go, as he was very shook up; he's only fourteen."</p><p>Morgan looked across at the second forensic white van drawing up, and then back to the faces of his team. "I've never seen anything like it," he said flatly.</p><p>"Is she fresh?" someone asked. Morgan shook his head.</p><p>"Hard to tell. I'd say maybe a couple of days, but don't quote me. The lab will give us a more specific time."</p><p>Morgan was a good-looking man with cropped dark hair and a leathery complexion. A golf fanatic, he spent most weekends out on his local course. He squashed his empty cup and tossed it into a bin. "Okay, let's get over there, and be prepared."</p><p>"High as a kite, is it?" asked a young detective.</p><p>"There's no stench, but what you see will turn your stomach."</p><p>They made their way down the same narrow lane that Danny had taken to get to the riverbank. There a white forensic tent was already erected, paper-suited scientists milling in and around it. There was a large box of paper suits outside, along with the usual masks, overshoes, and rubber gloves.</p><p>Bill Smart, a forensic expert, came out of the tent and looked at Morgan, shaking his head. "It's bloody unbelievable." He removed his rubber gloves. "I won't be eating breakfast this morning, and that's a first. She wasn't killed on site. Someone brought her here and set up a sick tableau that's had us all stunned. At first glance I'd say we don't have much forensic evidence; maybe come up with more when we get the body over to the lab."</p><p>As the murder team donned their paper suits, Bill Smart removed his, rolling it into a ball and dumping it into the waste bin provided. As he bent down to remove his protective shoes, he had to pause and take a deep breath. In his thirty years as a forensic expert, he had never come across anything so grotesque. It was the hideous gaping smile that had got to him. It would get to them all.</p><p>Anna adjusted her mask as she followed Morgan into the tent. This was now her fourth murder inquiry and she had come a long way since that first cadaver that had made her instantly sick. She had not seen DCI Langton, who she had worked with on the Alan Daniels case, since then, but she had often heard about his exploits. She doubted if he had paid any attention to hers, or the fact she had upped her rank from detective sergeant. Her subsequent cases had been domestic; to have cut her teeth on a serial killer like Daniels was something a good few junior detectives envied.</p><p>The detectives stood in silence outside the police tape encircling the body.</p><p>"She's been severed at the waist. The two sections of her body are about ten inches apart," Morgan said quietly. He gestured with his gloved hand. "Mouth slit each side. Hard to tell what she looked like before this was done to her. She's got abrasions all over her body."</p><p>Anna inched further forward, staring down at the dead woman. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed a young rookie detective turn away and hurry out of the tent. Anna didn't look up. She knew exactly how he felt, but remained calm as she took in the awful sight.</p><p>"We won't have anything from any clothes, obviously. First priority is to identify her." Morgan blinked as flashbulbs went off; photographs were being taken from every angle. He looked over to the doctor, a rotund man with thick glasses, who squinted back.</p><p>"Neat job. Whoever did the dissection knew what they were doing. Her blood's been drained: reason her skin is so white. I'd put the approx time of death at two or three days ago." He headed out of the tent, sidestepping two scientists in his haste. Morgan followed.</p><p>"Doc, can you just give me a few minutes?"</p><p>"Outside. Can't talk in there." The doctor and Morgan moved further away from the tent. "Jesus God, what animal did that to her?"</p><p>"Is there anything else you can tell me?"</p><p>"No, I was just called out to determine your victim was dead. I've got to get back to surgery."</p><p>"You said it looked professional," Morgan said.</p><p>"Well, it looks like it to me, but the pathologist will give you more details. It's a very neat cut, not jagged, and a thin-bladed knife was used on her mouth. How thin, how long, though, I couldn't tell you. There are further cuts to her face, neck, shoulders, and legs."</p><p>Morgan sighed, wanting more details. He turned back to stare at the flapping tent opening. One by one his team came out, subdued and shocked. They removed their paper suits and overshoes. Anna was last out and by the time she'd discarded her suit, the others were heading back toward the car park. She looked up the bank to see that a group of spectators had already gathered on the road. The sightlines between them were clear: the killer obviously wanted the victim found quickly. Whoever it was might even be watching them at work. The thought chilled her.</p><p></p><p>Richmond police station was only ten minutes' drive from the murder site, so the incident room had been set up there. They regrouped at eleven thirty as a large whiteboard was being erected. Desks and tables with computers were brought in for the team to work at. They busied themselves, selecting their areas, as Morgan stood in front of them.</p><p>"Okay, let's get started," Morgan said, and burped; he excused himself and took an antacid tablet. "We need to know who the victim is. We'll be getting photographs in, but until we get her identified and the lab reports back, there's not a lot we have to go on. According to the doctor, the work on her body looked professional, so we could be after a suspect with medical or surgical experience."</p><p>Anna put up her hand. "By the way the body was displayed, knowing it would be visible from the road and therefore would be found quickly, do you think the killer could be local?"</p><p>"Possibly," Morgan said as he crunched his tablet. He stared ahead, as if trying to think of what he should say next, and then shrugged. "Let's start with missing persons in this area."</p><p></p><p>The victim was eased into a thick plastic body bag and removed from the site at one fifteen. A team of uniformed officers had already been assigned a fingertip search of the area. Due to the good weather and early-morning frost, the ground was hard, so any footprints were few and far between.</p><p>Morgan had also asked for a house-to-house to be started on the properties overlooking the river. He knew this murder had been carefully planned, but they still might get lucky if someone had seen a car in or around the area during either the night or early morning.</p><p></p><p>Photographs of the victim were pinned up in the incident room to an uneasy silence from the team. In the past few years, such photographs had been kept in files rather than displayed: it was felt that the investigating detectives were not helped in their work by the emotional impact of constantly seeing death staring down at them. There was also the possibility that a relative or someone being questioned might see them and become distressed; however, Morgan insisted the photographs should be on view. He felt it was necessary for each and every one of his team to understand the gravity of the case. The murder was going to create a media frenzy. Until the killer was arrested, there would be no weekend leave.</p><p>By six o'clock that evening, their Jane Doe was still unidentified.</p><p></p><p>DAY TWO</p><p>The lists of missing persons in the Richmond area yielded nothing, so the net was spread wider. None of the residents of the riverside houses had seen anything suspicious, not even a parked car. The area was not well lit, so their killer would have been able to come and go undetected at night. What they were able to ascertain, however, was that a resident walking his dog at two in the morning passed the murder site and saw nothing. Therefore, their killer had deposited the body between the hours of two and six.</p><p></p><p>DAY THREE</p><p>Day three and they were ready at the mortuary. Morgan asked Anna and another detect...</p></p><h2>Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler&#39;s Eagle&#39;s Nest</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

The Prince awakens Beauty with a kiss. And I thought, all right, what if he brought a kind of liberation, an induction into a world of bizarre yet irresistible delights? It has to be remembered that within the frame of a sadomasochistic fantasy like the Beauty trilogy, the readers are invited to identify with and enjoy the predicament of the slaves. The books aren&#x2019;t about literal cruelty; they&#x2019;re about surrender, the fun of imagining you have no choice but to enjoy sex. Beauty&#x2019;s slavery is delicious, sensuous, abandoned, and ultimately liberating. This is all part of the framework. And it seemed to work exquisitely with the old fairy tale. And of course the fairy tale removes us from everyday life; it removes us from the intrusion of garish headlines, literal violence, and all the ugliness of crime. We go into a gilded dream here, luscious and engulfing, in which we&#x2019;re free to imagine all sorts of things&#x2014;a fairy-tale world indeed.</p> <p>As Anne Rice, I&#x2019;m known for certain kinds of novels; the Roquelaure books retain the name Roquelaure (even with my name added) to indicate that this is something &#x201c;different.&#x201d; If Anne Rice is one kind of savory dish, well this is another entirely. And some might find it far too spicy for their taste. I don&#x2019;t like the idea of confusing or disappointing readers, so the pen name helps with that. Of course, there are many people who have read all my work, including the Roquelaure novels, and they see me as a multifaceted writer. But the Roquelaure material is erotica, without reservation, and it needs that pen name on the label, so to speak. The pen name says: Anne Rice is doing something very different here.</p> <p>I felt I needed the anonymity of the pen name to write freely, to pursue an authentic erotica without being inhibited or self-conscious. And it worked wonders to imagine myself &#x201c;cloaked&#x201d; by the name Roquelaure, which is a kind of French cloak&#x2014;named after the Frenchman who popularized it. My father was still living then and I didn&#x2019;t want him to know about the books either. In fact, there were lots of friends and relatives whom I didn&#x2019;t want to worry about as I developed the writing. There was quite a bit of exposure involved in writing such graphic sexual fantasies. It was frightening now and then, and it was thrilling. Eventually, I told my father about the books, asking him not to read them, and I did put my name on them. I adjusted completely to people knowing I&#x2019;d written them. But only after I&#x2019;d finished with the trilogy&#x2014;as I recall.</p> <p>A pen name enables you not only to cloak what you are doing from friends and family; it gives you a new freedom to do something you would not do as yourself. I have thought of writing some new erotica, and I must confess I imagined using a new pen name for it. I don&#x2019;t know whether I&#x2019;ll pursue it, but I do find the freedom of the pen name attractive.</p> <p>When the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy books were first published, they were underground books. They had the backing of a major mainstream publisher, yes, but the publication, though dignified and beautiful, was relatively quiet. But different readers embraced the books almost at once. They clearly appealed to young people, and older married people, to gays and straights. And they&#x2019;ve sold steadily ever since they first appeared. Women come up to me at signings with babies in strollers and giggle and laugh and say, &#x201c;We love your dirty books.&#x201d; People of all ages, actually, present the books to be signed.</p> <p>Why do I think these particular books have been popular? Two reasons. First, I think it is because they involve no harsh, garish violence at all. They involve game playing, really. No one is burned or cut or hurt. Certainly no one is killed. Indeed the whole sadomasochistic predicament is presented as a glorified game played out in luxurious rooms and with very attractive people, and involving very attractive slaves. There are endless motifs offered for dominance and submission, for surrender and love. It&#x2019;s like a theme park of dominance and submission, a place to go to enjoy the fantasy of being overpowered by a beautiful man or woman and delightfully compelled to surrender and feel keening pleasure, without the slightest serious harm. I think it&#x2019;s authentic to the way many who share this kind of fantasy really feel. I think what makes it work for people is the combination of the very graphic and unsparing sexual details mixed with the elegant fairy-tale world.</p> <p>Unfortunately a lot of hackwork pornography is written by those who don&#x2019;t share the fantasy, and they slip into hideous violence and ugliness, thinking the market wants all that, when the market never really did. Second, this is shamelessly erotic. It pulls no punches at being what it is. It&#x2019;s excessive and it is erotica. Before these books, a lot of women read what were called &#x201c;women&#x2019;s romances&#x201d; where they had to mark the few &#x201c;hot pages&#x201d; in the book. I said, well, look, try this. Maybe this is what you really want, and you don&#x2019;t have to mark the hot pages because every page is hot. Every page is about sexual fulfillment. Every page is meant to give you pleasure. There are no boring parts. Yet it&#x2019;s very &#x201c;romantic.&#x201d; And well, I think this worked.</p> <p>Lots of people enjoy imagining themselves passive, in the hands of a beautiful lover, male or female, who will force them to enjoy themselves. It&#x2019;s a common idea, and it cuts across gender and class. Men love these sorts of fantasies as much as women. And these books offer all kinds of gender combinations; women dominating men and women; men dominating men and women. The books offer ornate and seductive variations on the themes; and all of it is interwoven in stories with real characters, and again, the emphasis is on a lush, sensuous realm in which all this happens. There are very detailed descriptions of physical interaction and response; but the fairy-tale spell is sustained.</p> <p>I also went all the way with exploring the mind-set of sadomasochism as I saw it, letting the fantasy characters talk in depth about what they felt and what they enjoyed and what thrilled them as they were humiliated and overwhelmed. I suspect that for some readers, this kind of deep exploration of the mentality of the participants was entirely new.</p> <p>Is this why they appealed to so many, because people want this very combination of elements? Perhaps.</p> <p>I certainly never found the combination of elements I wanted in anyone else&#x2019;s erotica. So I offered what I could not find; a light touch; elegance; preciseness; a dreamlike kingdom; a dream in which people explore their need to be passive and to &#x201c;pretend&#x201d; that someone gorgeous and irresistible is &#x201c;making&#x201d; them do it.</p> <p>Psychiatrists have written volumes on the nature of the sadomasochistic fantasy, but when I wrote the trilogy I didn&#x2019;t know of any fiction that really enabled you to slide in it and &#x201c;play&#x201d; the way I wanted to play. So I wrote the books I couldn&#x2019;t find.</p> <p>I never thought a book as eccentric as <i>Interview with the Vampire</i> would have mass appeal. I only knew that I wanted to &#x201c;be with the vampire&#x201d; in the story, tell it from his point of view. I wanted to be inside his head and heart and reveal his voice and his pain. Now as it turned out, other people were exploring this same kind of thing&#x2014;the backstory of the villain, the monster, or the comic book hero and heroine who&#x2019;d always been described from a distance or in brittle form. People wanted to explore all kinds of super characters and hear their intimate musings. And I began to see more and more of this&#x2014;movies made in which Superman could bear his soul, and Lois Lane could really talk about what it meant to love him. The demand for such romantic fantasies grew and grew. But did I have any idea that would happen? No. I wrote what I wanted to read. Well, the same thing is true with the Beauty books.</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t know whether that many other people had the fantasies. After all, we didn&#x2019;t talk much about them. Only a small elite knew about the mysterious <i>Story of O</i>. But I knew I had these fantasies, and I wanted to share them, and I felt an overwhelming desire to do them &#x201c;right.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t want to compromise, water them down, or shrink from the most humiliating detail. I wanted to really delve into intense sensuous pleasure but put a gilded frame around a safe place for the reader from which he or she could go and come with ease.</p> <p>Of course these books have from time to time been banned. I never expected a library to stock the Beauty trilogy. I know that many libraries respond to community standards, and I just never thought about it much at all. I did notice and I couldn&#x2019;t help notice that the books sold well and steadily, and that at every signing I gave, people brought them to be signed. Recently, I&#x2019;ve signed as many copies of the Beauty books as I have of any other book I&#x2019;ve written. So I don&#x2019;t worry too much about being banned. I&#x2019;ve always shocked people. Years ago, I published a novel about the eighteenth-century castrati opera singers, titled <i>Cry to Heaven</i>. Someone brought a copy back to a bookstore in Stockton, California, and demanded his money back. &#x201c;This is pornography,&#x201d; he said. There are always some people objecting to what I do. I&#x2019;m grateful the Beauty books have been embraced and sustained over the years.</p> <p>As a feminist, I&#x2019;m very much supportive of equal rights for women in all walks of life. And that includes for me the right of every woman to write out her sexual fantasies and to read books filled with sexual fantasies that she enjoys. Men have always enjoyed all kinds of pornography. How can it be wrong for women to have the same right? We&#x2019;re sexual beings! And fantasy is where we can do the things we can&#x2019;t do in ordinary life. A woman has a right to imagine herself carried away by a handsome prince, and to choose for herself as she writes, the color of his hair and eyes, and imagine his silky voice. She has a right to make him as tall as she wants and as strong as he wants. Why not? Men have always allowed themselves such fantasies.</p> <p>Famous madams have told us for decades that powerful men love to be dominated and come to them for role playing that allows the male client to be passive. In fact, some madams have said that men who enjoy playing the passive role are often men who are very powerful in real life. Well, women today are more powerful than ever. They&#x2019;re Supreme Court judges, senators, doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, executives, soldiers, cops. They can excel in all walks of life. And why shouldn&#x2019;t they be able to go home from the courtroom, the university, or the office and kick back and &#x201c;pretend&#x201d; they&#x2019;re being swept away to the Queen&#x2019;s sadomasochistic kingdom where all the fairy-tale court will watch them being ravaged by the handsome Prince?</p> <p>The literary world today is wide open for all kinds of creative endeavors. We are in a new golden age in which fantasy, science fiction, speculative fiction, historical drama, horror, gothic, and supernatural romance are all mainstream. Well, the same holds true now obviously for erotica. People in general are &#x201c;out of the closet&#x201d; as enjoyers of erotic books. The novel <i>50 Shades of Grey</i> has proved this. And I am discovering that the Beauty books in spite of all their playful excess&#x2014;are for the first time going mainstream.</p> <p>But I wouldn&#x2019;t continue Beauty&#x2019;s story. I felt that ended just the way I wanted. But I might write some more. I don&#x2019;t think I did all I could do in these books, within the fantasy itself, in admitting how much the slaves enjoyed it&#x2014;how they loved it. I&#x2019;d deepen that aspect, and still keep the tension, if I did them today.</p> <p>People are much more comfortable today admitting and talking about what they enjoy in fiction and film. Much more. People are &#x201c;out of the closet&#x201d; about sexuality, period. The whole world knows women are sensual human beings as well as men. It&#x2019;s no secret anymore that women want to read sexy fiction just as men do, and there&#x2019;s a new frankness about the varieties of fantasies one might enjoy. So many clich�s have been broken and abandoned. And this is a wonderful thing.</p> <p>&#x2014;ANNE RICE</p> <p>JUNE 2012</p>Anne Rice is one of America&#39;s most read and celebrated authors.

The years after WWII saw the company founder, as wartime production restrictions and poor planning delayed the company&#x2019;s entry into the diesel market. Baldwin eventually did produce a number of diesel locomotives, including transfer and cab units and the four-axle 750 and 1,000 hp switchers and road switchers profiled in this booklet. By 1956, the company could no longer compete with its rivals, and it stopped producing locomotives altogether. Its dissolution was a sad end for a once-mighty company, and symbolized the end of the steam era. Originally published by Baldwin in 1949, this historic operator&#x2019;s manual was standard issue for the engineers operating four-axle 750 and 1,000 hp switchers and road switchers. Within its pages you&#x2019;ll find information about the engine&#x2019;s fuel oil, air, and electrical systems as well as basic operating information and troubleshooting procedures.</p><p></p><h2>A Dictionary of Jewish Names and Their History</h2><p>This reference examines the history of Jewish forenames and surnames, tracing the origin of each name and the changes that have occured over generations.</p><p>Researching the derivations of Jewish names is a complicated task, and one that Benzion Kaganoff takes on with admirable results. He delves into the roots of names from Aaron (and its derivatives Agronsky, Arkin, and Orlik) to Zwirn (German for thread), finding biblical, occupational, and regional origins for nearly 4,000 names. Because Jewish names have been adapted and modified so often over the years, it&#39;s all the more a triumph that Kaganoff has traced the history of so many common Jewish names and their offshoots.</p><h2>The Collected Stories of Jean Stafford</h2><p>&#34;The appearance of these stories in one volume is an event in our literature.

Now it&#39;s wintertime, and it&#39;s an especially snowy one with many outdoor activities that give the bully Danny Rugg even more opportunities to make mischief. When the Bobbseys meet Old Mr. Carford, a wealthy man with a sad past, he invites them to spend their three-week holiday break at his wonderful lodge on Lake Metoka, where there are opportunities for skating and ice-boating. Coincidentally, Danny Rugg is also spending his Christmas holidays near Snow Lodge, so when the Bobbseys narrowly escape a dangerous snowslide the bully is their first suspect. But there&#39;s also a question about some missing money that has caused trouble between Mr. Carford and his nephew Henry Burdock, and the Bobbseys do their best to get to the bottom of the long-ago mystery.</p><p></p><h2>Master Strokes: Watercolor: A Step-by-Step Guide to Using the Techniques of the Masters</h2><p>Each of seven lessons provides background information on a masterpiece, discusses the work as a whole, and gives a detailed evaluation of the artist&#x2019;s style. Special attention is given to watercolor techniques&#x2014;including backruns, blending, brushwork, glazing, and impressing.<br></p><p>Harrison has created two unique and exciting books based on the methods of the masters. It may seem odd at first to study an oil by Courbet to learn pastel techniques or an oil by Gainsborough to learn the art of watercolor portraiture, but it works beautifully. The core of each book focuses in detail on a series of master paintings, each chosen to illustrate a specific subject area, such as portraiture, still life, or landscape. Each is followed by a tutorial in which a contemporary artist demonstrates not how to copy the original but how to use specific techniques to create a new work. Thus, the point of analyzing Winslow Homer's "The Red Canoe" is to learn how to paint figures in a landscape in one's own work. These two books should be added to most collections to complement Ettore Maiotti's earlier fine volume, The Oil Painting Handbook: Learning from the Masters, now out of print. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Geography from A to Z : A Picture Glossary</h2><p><p>Have you ever wondered what a badland is?

He is a free-lance writer living in New York City and is the author of <em>Geography from A to Z </em>and <em>Maps and Globes,</em> which was featured on <em>Reading Rainbow.</em></p>Grade 2-4 Sixty-three geographical terms are simply defined and illustrated. Clear, uncluttered illustrations with bright contrasting colors and black outlines help clarify the meaning of each term. Little prior knowledge is expected of readers, and almost all terms used in definitions which might puzzle some readers are defined elsewhere in the glossary. Both common words such as mountain and less frequently encountered terms such as meander are defined. Some sub-definitions are included, such as cataract and cascade under waterfall. While alternate terms are usually given, alternate spellings are not, so children would not find out that a key (defined) is also a cay (not mentioned). A major drawback is the lack of a pronunciation guide. Most young readers seeing the first word, archipelago, won't know how to pronounce it. While the focus of most illustrations is clear, there are a few places where readers may be confused. For example, one small picture could be either a marsh or a bog; both are defined on the page. Given the renewed emphasis on geographical skills and the scarcity of materials for this age group, this book would be a priority purchase for most collections. It is not, however, a book many children will select to read independently. Louise L. Sherman, Anna C.

In clear and understandable prose, each instrument's function, especially as it relates to the other members of its family, and its sound are described in sometimes poetic phrases--"its song can be bright as laughter, light as air, soft as a whisper, or sad as a tear." Single- or double-page spreads feature a large watercolor illustration of an animal playing the instrument under discussion. Although most are aptly chosen for their instruments--a polar bear playing a bassoon and a lion as the conductor--some are disconcerting. The sight of a chimpanzee in a pink dress and frilly pantaloons sitting at a grand piano lessens the effectiveness of that instrument's description. Overall, however, these creatures add a lively note and enable the book to be friendly and accessible without exhibiting the overriding silliness found in Eugen's Orchestranimals (Scholastic, 1989). A good book to use in the classroom as well as individually, this is a collaboration between two artists whose love for music and the orchestra is evident throughout. --Jane Marino, White Plains Pub .

One of those teams is the 1947 Brooklyn Dodgers, the first racially integrated Major League team of the twentieth century. The addition of Jackie Robinson to its roster changed not only baseball but also the nation. Yet Robinson was just one member of that memorable club, which included Carl Furillo, Gil Hodges, Pee Wee Reese, Pete Reiser, Duke Snider, Eddie Stanky, Arky Vaughan, and Dixie Walker. Also present was a quartet of baseball&#x2019;s most unforgettable characters: co-owners Branch Rickey and Walter O&#x2019;Malley, suspended manager Leo Durocher, and radio announcer Red Barber.<br> This book is the first to offer biographies of everyone on that incomparable team as well as accounts of the moments and events that marked the Dodgers&#x2019; 1947 season: Commissioner Happy Chandler suspending Durocher, Rickey luring his old friend Burt Shotton out of retirement to replace Durocher, and brilliant outfielder Reiser being sidelined after running into a fence. In spite of all this, the Dodgers went on to win the National League pennant over the heavily favored St. Louis Cardinals. And of course, there is the biggest story of the season, where history and biography coalesce: Jackie Robinson, who overcame widespread hostility to become Rookie of the Year&#x2014;and to help the Dodgers set single-game attendance records in cities around the National League.</p><p>Lyle Spatz&#x2019;s many books include <i>Dixie Walker: A Life in Baseball</i> and (with coauthor Steve Steinberg) <i>1921: The Yankees, the Giants, and the Battle for Baseball Supremacy in New York</i>, winner of the Seymour Medal (Nebraska, 2010)."Though there have been numerous books on the Dodgers of that era and on the notable personalities, this is the first to present biographies of every member of the organization in that famous baseball year."&#x2014;Margart Heilbrun, <i>Library Journal</i> (Margart Heilbrun <i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Team That Forever Changed Baseball and America: The 1947 Brooklyn Dodgers</i> is stunning in its thorough look at every player, coach and front office member of the team.

After completing a brief residential motorcycle course and hastily remortgaging his apartment, Mike set off alone, resolving to go wherever the road took him. By the end of his journey, Mike had traveled nearly 20,000 miles and had roamed from the Arctic Circle in the north of Europe to the Mediterranean coast in the south, and from the Portuguese Atlantic coast in the west to the Iraqi border of Turkey in the east.

Reprint.</p><p>This handsomely produced large-format volume traces over 25 years of the gay and lesbian movement's history through the pages of its foremost newsmagazine, the Advocate. (Thompson is senior editor). This is an appropriate choice for the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, generally considered the birth of the modern gay and lesbian movement in the US. Going year by year, this volume offers a survey of major political, cultural, social, and medical events in the history of the gay and lesbian movement, as reported in the Advocate since its inception in September 1967. Each year receives a single chapter, with an opening essay by a prominent gay or lesbian journalist or author, a chronology of key events of the year, and a selection of articles drawn from the magazine. The book takes readers from a time when homosexuality was treated as a pathology, and when gays and lesbians were for the most part unorganized and deep in the closet, to 1992, when a vocal gay and lesbian movement helped elect Bill Clinton president. The book is relentlessly honest about the divisions within the gay and lesbian communities (particularly concerning the growing AIDS crisis as it broke in the mid-1980s) and earnestly self-critical in its evaluation of the magazine's coverage of many issues (shortchanging lesbians and people of color in its earlier days). Many interviews are excerpted, with subjects as diverse as Jesse Jackson, Christopher Isherwood, Milton Berle, and Michel Foucault. Readers can also see the Advocate itself evolve from a spirited amateurism into a magazine of exceptionally high journalistic standards. A useful and relatively comprehensive guide to nearly 30 years of gay and lesbian history, but one wishes for fewer and longer excerpts. Also, the magazine's excellent cartoonists get somewhat short shrift. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Neither a chronological history nor a comprehensive encyclopedia, this compendium of features, interviews, and newsbites from the first 25 years (1967-92) of the Advocate magazine is suitable for both casual browsing and serious research. The book is divided into yearly chapters, each introduced by an essay and a two-page summary of the year's news. Comprising the bulk of each chapter, seven to ten archival articles cover both events and personalities, with scattered marginalia (e.g., outrageous quotes, political cartoons, letters to the editor) illuminating these longer stories. Some of the best writing is found in the often very personal introductory essays, authored by prominent lesbians and gay men from the worlds of academia (Martin Duberman), literature (John Preston), politics (Urvashi Vaid) and journalism (Richard Rouilard). However, this sum is greater than its parts; the reader closes the book with interlaced memories of dozens of sometimes contradictory, always provacative individuals sharing a common goal. This unique resource is highly recommended for public libraries and is also appropriate for academic collections supporting gay studies and journalism programs. --Eric Bryant, "Library Journal"<br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Steely Blue</h2><p>Two best friends, Steely Burns and Jack Haggerty, grow up to find their respective lives as firemen very different</p><p></p><h2>Mediation Advocacy (NITA&#39;s Practical Guide Series) (NITA practical guide series)</h2><p>You will learn how mediation works, what cases are suited for mediation, how to select a mediator, and how to best prepare yourself and your client for mediation.

Auster&#39;s other work includes The New York Trilogy and Hand to Mouth, and the screenplays Smoke and Blue in the Face.</p><p>Paul Auster was born in Newark, New Jersey in the United Stat es in 1947. He graduated from Columbia University with an MA degree. In 1970 he worked as a merchant seaman on an Esso oil tanker. From 1971 to 1974 he lived in France, spending two years in Paris and one in Provence. After returning to New York in 1974, he began his writing career.Throughout the 1970s he wrote mainly poetry and essays which appeared in various magazines including the New York Review of Books. During the 1980s he concentrated on prose writing: a memoir and four novels were published.His screenplay Smoke and Blue in the Face was published in April 1996 to coincide with the release of the film, and in 1999 Faber published the screenplay Lulu on the Bridge. The Art of Hunger (a collection of essays, interviews and prose) and his Selected Poems were published in November 1998.He is the author of nine novels, including The New York Trilogy&lt;/Vanessa Redgrave is not so much an actress as a force of nature; her screen presence radiates a disturbing potency impossible to ignore. Here she reins it in to deliver an appropriately detached portrayal of a sheltered young Jewess cast on her own devices in a nightmarish world of terror and entropy. While playing against the unremitting horror of the first-person narration, she vividly impersonates the characters in dialogue scenes. If she errs, it&#39;s by relying on her overflowing treasure chest of technique instead of penetrating Auster&#39;s novel to its depths. Y.R. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Robert Ballard&#39;s Lusitania</h2><p>Of course, Dr Robert Ballard will forever remain the man who found the Titanic, but in this book he also provides the reader with an extremely well documented account of the loss of the Lusitania. Mysteries are mysteries and whilst there are those experts which insist such and such happened, there will also be those who assert the opposite. I shouldn&#39;t say this I know, but it the way in which Bob Ballard takes such a thorough approach to his subject, it leaves one feeling that the only book you need to read on the entire subject of the loss of the Lusitania is this one. Exploring the Lusitania - yet another four-funnelled passenger liner built before WW1, is a large coffee-table book approx. A4 size. Just a glance at the pictures throughout the richly illustrated pages (227 altogether) reveals the extent of the research to which the author has gone on behalf of the reader. There are many historic pictures of the ship itself - including when she was no more than a keel. Others include paintings of the day, newspaper cuttings and postcards showing internal and external views. Then there are the photographs of the tragedy itself and the effect it had upon the people of Ireland. Photographs of seemingly unimportant people at the booking office and individuals such as the Captain. Dr Ballard has been equally thorough when it comes to detailing the U Boat which sank the Lusitania and we are treated to almost the same level of coverage of vessel and individuals and their trade of war. Once again, however, the author has put together the most outstanding collection of artwork created by Ken Marschall. From thousands of photographic images taken from the wreckage itself, Bob Ballard created a complete montage (i.e. a big photograph made up of thousands of little photographs) of the various sections of the wreck so that Mr Marschall was able to provide us with the most accurate paintings of various sections and even the entire wreck. The one painting I had to look at again and again was the painting of the sinking across pages 96/97. For a moment there I thought the world&#39;s greatest photographer had been on hand to capture the event.</p><p>An excellent and interesting read which showed factual exploration showing how man can interact and explore the deepest mysteries of nature. --By Mr. Graham Michie</p><h2>The Selected Letters of Elia Kazan</h2><p>This collection of nearly three hundred letters gives us the life of Elia Kazan unfiltered, with all the passion, vitality, and raw honesty that made him such an important and formidable stage director (<i>A Streetcar Named Desire, Death of a Salesman</i>), film director (<i>On the Waterfront, East of Eden</i>), novelist, and memoirist.<br><br> Elia Kazan&#x2019;s lifelong determination to be a &#x201c;sincere, conscious, practicing artist&#x201d; resounds in these letters&#x2014;fully annotated throughout&#x2014;in every phase of his career: his exciting apprenticeship with the new and astonishing Group Theatre, as stagehand, stage manager, and actor (<i>Waiting for Lefty, Golden Boy</i>) . . . his first tentative and then successful attempts at directing for the theater and movies (<i>The Skin of Our Teeth,</i> <i>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</i>) . . . his cofounding in 1947 of the Actors Studio and his codirection of the nascent Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center . . . his innovative and celebrated work on Broadway (<i>All My Sons, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, J.B</i>.) and in Hollywood (<i>Gentleman&#x2019;s Agreement, Splendor in the Grass, A Face in the Crowd, Baby Doll</i>) . . . his birth as a writer.<br><br> Kazan directed virtually back-to-back the greatest American dramas of the era&#x2014;by Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams&#x2014;and helped shape their future productions.

He is Principal of KingstonCollege in London, and author of the best-selling Dictionary of World Mythology, as well as a number of books on the civilizations of East Asia.This work covers three great traditions of European mythology: classical (Greco-Roman), Celtic (including Welsh), and Norse (including Slavic). Each section has a brief introduction giving a broad overview of the historical setting of the tradition, including a map of the territories where the myths were believed. The sections are in dictionary format with extensive cross-references. There are also two-page spreads on such special topics as "Voyagers" and "Heroes" in the classical section, "Sagas and Seers" and "Single Combat" in the Celtic, and "Treasures and Talismans" and "Tragic Lovers" in the Norse.<p>The text is lavishly illustrated with everything from photographs of ancient artifacts to contemporary watercolors, most in full color. The Pre-Raphaelites, Aubrey Beardsley, and Arthur Rackham are heavily represented. The book is designed so that the illustrations enhance rather than obstruct the text. The caption for the illustration of Lif and Lifthrasir in the Norse section does not agree with the entry as to who is male and who is female. A pronunciation guide for Gaelic, Welsh, and Slavic names would have been helpful.

In his discussion of Warhol, for example, Danto declares, "[T]he significant art of this extraordinary period . . . has to be assessed as much on grounds of speculative theory as on those of aesthetic discrimination." He goes on to characterize the art of the 20th century as "a collective investigation by artists into the philosophical nature of art." <i>Encounters &amp; Reflections</i> won a National Book Critics Circle Award in 1990.<b>Arthur C.

Welcome to Laurie Notaro&#x2019;s Christmastime. <br><br>In ten brand-new stories and three previously published favorites, Notaro shares the sidesplitting daily disasters of the holidays, like finding herself on emergency feminine product recon at midnight on Christmas Eve; surrendering to the inevitable Horrible Gift Parade by simply asking for holiday dish towels and giant white underpants from Sears; battling the morons in line at the Seventh Circle of Hell, otherwise known as the do-it-yourself craft store; and trying to live down her reputation as the Most Unfun Christmas Party Guest Ever, due to an unfortunate misunderstanding involving a fake overdose and emergency paramedics. <br><br>So whether you find yourself at the Dull and Smart Party or the Raucous and Stupid Party this holiday season, you&#x2019;ll always know where to find Laurie&#x2013;just follow the chocolate trail over to the cheese platter. She&#x2019;ll be the one dialing the cops.</p><p>Like her other titles, Laurie Notaro's <i>An Idiot Girl's Christmas</i> is a bon bon of a book--one that is so honestly observed that, if you are at work, you will find yourself sneaking in time to read it at your desk in the middle of the day, snorting with laughter. There are few writers who can nail the particular humiliation of, say, buying a box of tampons in a crowded store while a small cadre of punks makes unfortunate jokes behind you. Or who can let loose the funny fury of wrong-headed Christmas gifts, such as her mother's peculiar affinity for food-scented candles: <p> </p><blockquote>Always on my list is a scrumptious delicacy from my mother's favorite Wax Candle Baked Goods store. I don't know where my mother found a wax store that specializes in baked-goods and pastry candles, but she did. Good job Mom!...It's the perfect diet food, because biting into one is like biting into Jennifer Lopez's double-decker ass at Madam Tussaud's, kind of like sinking your teeth into a thick, dense bar of Irish Spring--without the flavor.</blockquote> <p> With some new and some best-of material (the venerable Jingle Bell piece about a Barney-obsessed neighbor is here), this volume covers many a family holiday at the Notaro household, with an amusing assortment of ill-adjusted siblings, in-laws, and that grand dame of dysfunction and buzz kill, Notaro's mother. Or at least the ever-so-lightly fictionalized version of Notaro's mother, who plays the foil to Notaro's perpetually underfunded, tortured, and sweetly Machiavellian self. The palpable and universal mother-daughter tension in their relationship is best mined in the chapter, "Oh Holy Night," or "The Year I Ruined Christmas," in which the n'er do well's daughter purse is lost, found, and returned home with a tire track across it and without Notaro herself: </p><p> </p><blockquote>"I was dead?" I asked my mother eagerly, trying hard to fight the urge to jump up and down in glee. "Oh my God. I can't believe it. This is fantastic. Did you cry?"</blockquote> <blockquote>"Well, almost," my mother confessed. "But then again there was the relief of getting the second use out of your prom dress."</blockquote> <p> In the end, wit and clever revenge on dull party guests trump the rich, thin, and conventionally pretty girls every time. Notaro's <i>Idiot Girl's Christmas</i> is a holiday worth celebrating. <i>--Megan Halverson</i></p>Laurie Notaro loves Christmas, despite the fact that last year she was the unfortunate recipient a jar of previously owned bath salts and an XXL sweater with a snowman on it.

This is her fifth book.</p><h2>I Am That</h2><p>Collecting Nisargadatta Maharaj&#39;s speeches on the Advaita Vedanta, I Am That explores the human existence and our association with the body. Believing that the body is all limits the consciousness and it is only when we move beyond and look at the Atman that we are able to realize ourselves for who we are. Realization that we are, that we truly &#34;are&#34; is pivotal in Advaita philosophy, freeing us from self-doubt and weakness. Nisargadatta Maharaj&#39;s teachings and messages permeate within this book, translated by Maurice Frydman from the original Marathi.</p><p>Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj was an Indian spiritual guru and Advaita philosopher. Born into a poor Hindu family as Maruti Shivrampant Kambli, he was inducted into the Inchgiri branch of the Navnath Sampradaya by his guru Siddharameshwar Maharaj. <br><br> In two and a half years of association, Maruti realized his true self and awoke to the cause, renaming himself Nisargadatta. He was installed as the head of the Inchgiri doctrine after his guru's passing. Widely remembered for his propagation of the Advaita Vedanta, Nisargadatta Maharaj schooled many students and his teachings have been collected into numerous books, some of which are: Master of Self Realization, Self Knowledge and Self Realization, Nectar of Immortality, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj Discourses on the Eternal, I AM The complete "I am" quotes of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj and The Experience of Nothingness.</p><h2>Buddhist Care for the Dying and Bereaved</h2><p>Since its beginning, Buddhism has been intimately concerned with confronting and understanding death and dying. Indeed, the tradition emphasizes turning <i>toward</i> the realities of sickness, old age, and death - and using those very experiences to develop wisdom and liberating compassion. In recent decades, Buddhist chaplains and caregivers all over the world have been drawing on this tradition to contribute greatly to the development of modern palliative and hospice care in the secular world at large. Specifically Buddhist hospice programs have been further developing and applying traditional Buddhist practices of preparing for death, attending the dying, and comforting the bereaved.<br><br><i>Buddhist Care for the Dying and Bereaved</i> contains comprehensive overviews of the best of such initiatives, drawn from diverse Buddhist traditions, and written by practitioners who embody the best of contemporary Buddhist hospice care programs practiced all over the world today.<br><br>Contributors include Carl B.

Julie Chijo Hanada<br><br>In many ways the chaplain&#x2019;s contribution to the medical environment is to balance the emotional and intellectual reactions for staff. Chaplains work as part of the medical team for the benefit of both patients and staff. They help support the medical team to stay connected, compassionate, and focused, and to provide a balance between the medical and the religious or spiritual. When staff feel settled, they are more efficient and effective, and this decreases burn out. The medical education of doctors and nurses has evolved to include more training in being attentive to the emotional and spiritual needs of the patient and family. They understand the value of offering empathy and compassion, but often find the support for themselves lacking.<br><br>Currently, I am the director of the department of spiritual care at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA. In addition, I am an educator with the Association of Clinical Pastoral Education program. Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) is a graduate-level program with clinical opportunities for students of all faith traditions who are interested in ministry or health care chaplaincy. The educational process bridges their academic theological foundation with ministry situations to people who, because of life&#x2019;s circumstances, are questioning meaning in their lives, their faiths, their spirituality. For example, up to this point in their formation as ministers, they have been studying how their religion understands human suffering; applying this understanding to people who are actually suffering often requires them to translate their intellectual understanding through their heart experience.<br><br>CPE is where students integrate the heart and the head, the intellect and the emotional, their academic understanding with their emotional stirrings. When students enter into a relationship with a patient and are willing to hear his or her pain and suffering, their own stories surface and things start to get messy for them. The educational experience for certified chaplains is designed to support this parallel process. In order to support them to do the reflective work necessary to grow and change, I have to create an environment that feels safe. I use concepts of play, art, film, and books. I also share my own stories, vulnerabilities, foibles, and idiosyncrasies. They know how human I am. My own personal work is to be willing to enter the chaos and mess. I walk alongside students who are willing to grow and change so they can be of service to others.<br><br>Just as my patients are usually not Buddhist, neither are my students. The Buddha&#x2019;s Four Noble Truths outline my work in all spiritual care encounters, whether with patients, staff, or students. When my students see patients in physical, emotional, or spiritual pain, it touches an emotion and can stir up a memory from their own lives. They experience dis-ease and I need to respond empathetically. We identify their dis-easeand begin to explore the cause or causes. When they are ready to move forward, we imagine options and outline a plan for when these same feelings come forward again. This is how they learn the craft of chaplaincy.<br><br>In the case of my student John, as he touched on his grief, I shifted into the role of his chaplain, offering empathetic responses so he felt known and companioned. This created a space for him to feel free to identify his dis-easeand explore its causes. He was open to exploring if there might be more to his sadness than his feelings for the parents of the deceased baby. He realized that these feelings were on the surface and that there was a deeper sadness that was getting stirred up. He was aware that he wanted to do something more for the couple that was different from his previous other death situations. His real feelings were of grief that his dreams of starting his own family were growing dimmer. Recognizing the deeper grief, John wept. When he was ready, he began to explore again the causes of his dis-ease. He said he was angry at God, at first for the parents&#x2019; loss. Then he went deeper and said he was mad for his own loss. How, he wondered, could God give a precious baby to this young couple then take it away, and how could God not hear the cries of his own heart? Back and forth we roamed between identifying dis-ease and exploring the causes. When he sighed deeply and wondered if he would ever find his life&#x2019;s partner, I heard him open up to imagining possibility. He was not demanding, angry, or absolute. His tone was not Will I <i>EVER</i> find someone?!&#x201d; Rather, it was I <i>wonder</i> if I&#x2019;ll find someone.&#x201d; To which my response was that perhaps it was a feeling he had in the moment, implying that this was not a consistent feeling for him. John could imagine that he would feel differently in the future. Possibilities exist for him.<br><br>In working with students, a key component to their professional development and growth is the ability to reflect on the encounters and integrate their new awareness into the next opportunity. In John&#x2019;s situation, he outlined a plan that included a sign in his cubicle that said, All in good time.&#x201d; Additionally, the anxiety he felt to do something extra for the couple could be put into context, and he could release his need to over-function in this situation. In this way, he did not deny feelings of sadness as they arose but rather acknowledged them and soothed them simultaneously. Through the process of compassionately moving into our dis-ease, our suffering has the potential to be transformed. What we experience is an unlimited potential for relating to others and for growth and change in ourselves. In supervision, I facilitate the learning environment where students grow in awareness of dis-ease, within themselves and with patients. I support students to use their own understanding and experiences with the source of compassion from their own faith tradition. By doing this, they are able to explore their potential as spiritual care providers.<br><br><b><i>Chapter 8</i><br>Actualizing Understanding:<br>Compassion, AIDS, Death, and Dying among the Poor</b><br>(Cambodia)<br><br>By Beth Kanji Goldring<br><br>Within the development of this vastly increased range of activities, the question of what it means to us that we are a Buddhist organization has also undergone radical change and development. In some ways, what it means to be Buddhist is straightforward. With some exceptions, we work as closely as possible within the Khmer Buddhist tradition. My staff is trained in the Khmer and Pali chanting done in the temples. We study meditation in the <i>vipassana</i> tradition of Sayadaw Mahasi from Burma, the same general Theravada tradition of Cambodia and Southeast Asia. We chant and meditate every day before going out to see patients. We chant on major precept days and several times a month in the Chea Chum Neas Mortuary. We give precepts and chant for patients who are dying and give eight-precept ordination when appropriate. We conduct funeral chanting for the dead and sometimes join in funeral services for families that cannot afford to bring in monks. We continue to give precepts and chant for people for forty-nine days following patient deaths. We sometimes provide small statues of the Buddha for patients. We provide a little money for families to go to the temples seven days after a death, along with urns for the bones of the dead. We continue to conduct ghost ceremonies when asked.<br><br>For our own development, we study Buddhist teachings and do extended meditation on Wednesdays. At least once a year, we hold a ten-day staff vipassana retreat. We train in the precepts, the perfections (<i>paramitas</i>), and the Four Noble Truths, as well as in other aspects of the Buddha&#x2019;s teaching. The training in the precepts and paramitas is vital. First, the precepts help provide inner safety by preventing us from doing harm. Second, the paramitas not only help us develop the necessary qualities of character for the development of insight, they are also profoundly important in allowing us to continue what is sometimes extraordinarily difficult and painful work over time and to be strengthened rather than weakened by it.<br><br>When I began this work, my unofficial supervisor and the head of the Maryknoll project used to say to me, If it is not life affirming for you, it will not be life affirming for the patients.&#x201d; I used to respond, Just because it is hard, doesn&#x2019;t mean it isn&#x2019;t life affirming.&#x201d; He would agree. After some years, there was a kind of sea change, and I began to experience a deep intimacy and peacefulness with patients, even under the most difficult and terrible circumstances. Even later, I began to trust and expect this intimacy to emerge. All of us currently on staff have long, deep familiarity with times sometimes moments, sometimes longer when both we and the patients (and families) are being held in something profound, wordless, intimate, and deep, when we are as much the recipients as the agents of sustaining compassion.<br><br>It is this experience of time and compassion that sustains the work and sustains us within it. All our training, our work on the development of character and insight, and our religious practices have both their testing ground and their fulfillment in this intimacy.<br><br>This intimacy is not restricted to our work with patients; it is the supporting fabric of every aspect of our lives. However, it is most fully tested in the work with patients. It is here that we not only experience intimacy but experience, see, and explore the barriers that keep us from it. The more fully we become capable of experiencing intimacy, the more aware we become of the many times when we are preoccupied, annoyed, resistant, distracted, and unable fully to be present. The patients are our teachers,&#x201d; is a favorite saying of one of my oldest staff members. The longer we work, the more fully we realize how deeply it is we who are in the patients&#x2019; debt.<br><br>Our formal study and practice of Buddhism provides us with both a container to hold this experience and a means of understanding it. Without the container, we would quickly reach and exhaust the limits of our own strength in the work. Without the understanding, we would not know what to do with the experience as it occurs. Because we work in extreme situations, directly in contact with life and death, and often under terrible conditions, we fail often. However, because we study the Buddha&#x2019;s teachings, not only formally but with our whole hearts, we live continually in the possibility of transcending our failures, and sometimes in the experience of that transcendence.<br><br>The Buddha often said to place nothing before one&#x2019;s own highest welfare. The Dalai Lama calls compassion enlightened selfishness.&#x201d; Our work gives us the daily practice in learning the meaning of these teachings and of testing our limits by putting our compassion into practice again and again. As we continue to work in this way, over time our life becomes very ordinary to us. As Suzuki Roshi wrote about Zen Practice, If you continue this simple practice every day, you will obtain some wonderful power. Before you attain it, it is something wonderful, but after you attain it, it is nothing special.&#x201d; This ordinariness is one of the greatest gifts we receive.<br></p><h2>The Kestrel</h2><p>The kingdom of Westmark is invaded by neighboring Regia, and Theo, now prince consort, and Mickle, the street urchin turned queen, are forced into battle with badly outnumbered forces</p><p><b>Lloyd Alexander</b>&nbsp;(1924-2007) was the author of more than forty books for children and adults, including the beloved children's fantasy series, the&nbsp;<i>Chronicles of Prydain</i>, one of the most widely read series in the history of fantasy and the inspiration for the animated Disney film, <i>The Black Cauldron</i>.

Shad Shifferdecker grabbed his friend&#x2019;s arm and yanked him away from the water fountain just as Lily Robbins leaned over to take a drink. Leo barely missed being brushed by Lily&#x2019;s flaming red hair. Lily straightened up and drove her vivid blue eyes into Shad. "I need for you to quit making fun of my hair," she said through her gritted teeth. She always gritted her teeth when she talked to Shad Shifferdecker. "Why can&#x2019;t you ever just say &#x2018;shut up&#x2019;?" Shad asked. "Why do you always have to sound like a counselor or something?" Lily didn&#x2019;t know what a counselor sounded like. She&#x2019;d never been to one. If Shad had, it hadn&#x2019;t helped much as far as she was concerned. He was still rude. "I&#x2019;m just being polite," Lily answered. Leo blinked his enormous gray eyes at Shad. "Shad, can you say &#x2018;polite&#x2019;?" "Shut up," Shad said and gave Leo a shove that landed him up against Daniel Tibbetts, his other partner in seeing how hateful a sixth-grade boy can be to a sixth-grade girl. Just then Ms. Gooch appeared at the head of the line, next to the water fountain, and held up her right hand. Hands shot up down the line as mouths closed and most everybody craned their necks to see her. Ms. Gooch was almost shorter than Lily. "All right, people." Lily was glad she didn&#x2019;t call them "boys and girls" the way the librarian did. "We&#x2019;re going to split up now. Boys will come with me girls will go into the library." "How come?" Shad blurted out, as usual. "The girls are going to a grooming workshop," Ms. Gooch said. She raised an eyebrow because Ms. Gooch could say more with one black eyebrow than most people could with a whole sentence. "Did you want to go with the girls and learn how to fix your hair and have great skin, Shad? I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;d love to have you." No, we would not, Lily wanted to say. But she never blurted out. She just turned to Reni and rolled her eyes. Reni rolled hers back. That was the thing about best friends, Lily had decided a while back. You could have entire conversations with each other, just by rolling your eyes or saying one key word that sent you both into giggle spasms. "No way!" Shad bellowed. "I don&#x2019;t want to look like no girl!" "Any girl," Ms. Gooch said. "All right, ladies go on to the library. Come back with beauty secrets!" Lily took off on Reni&#x2019;s heels in the direction of the library. Behind her, she heard Shad say just loudly enough for her to hear "That grooming lady better be pretty good if she&#x2019;s gonna do anything with Lily!" "Yeah, dude!" Leo echoed. Daniel just snorted. "Ignore them," Reni whispered to Lily as they pushed through the double doors to the inside of the school. "My mama says when boys say things like that, it means they like you." "Gross!" Lily wrinkled her nose. Besides, that was easy for Reni to say. Lily thought Reni was about the cutest girl in the whole sixth grade. She was black (Ms. Gooch said they were supposed to call her "African-American," but Reni said that took too long to say) and her skin was the smooth, rich color of Lily&#x2019;s dad&#x2019;s coffee when he put a couple of drops of milk in it. Mine&#x2019;s more like the milk, without the coffee! Lily thought. And even though Reni&#x2019;s hair was a hundred times curlier than Lily&#x2019;s naturally frizzy mass of auburn, it was always in little pigtails or braids or something. Her hair was under control, anyway. Lily&#x2019;s brother Art said Lily&#x2019;s hair always looked like enough for thirty-seven people the way it stuck out all over her head. But most important of all, Reni was as petite as a toy poodle, not tall and leggy like a giraffe. At least, that was the way Lily thought of herself. Even now, as they walked into the library, Lily tripped on the wipe-your-feet mat and plowed into a rolling rack of books. She rolled with it right into Mrs. Blain, the librarian, who said, "Boys and girls, please be careful where you&#x2019;re walking." It&#x2019;s just girls, Lily wanted to say to her. And I&#x2019;m so glad. Wouldn&#x2019;t Shad Shifferdecker have had something to say about that little move? Reni steered her to a seat in the front row of the half circles of chairs that had been formed in the middle of the library. The chairs faced a woman who busily took brushes and combs and tubes of things out of a classy-looking leather bag and set them on a table. Lily watched her for a minute. The lady wore her blond hair short and combed-with-her-fingers, the way all the women did on TV; her nails were long and polished red, and they clacked against the table when she set things down on it. Lily could smell her from the front row she smelled expensive, like a department store cosmetics counter. Lily thought about how her mother grabbed lipstick while they were shopping for groceries at Acme and then only put it on when Dad dragged her to some university faculty party. As for having her nails done high school P.E. teachers didn&#x2019;t have fingernails. Lily&#x2019;s mind and eyes wandered off to the bookshelves. I&#x2019;d much rather be finding a book on Indian headdresses, she thought as she looked wistfully at the plastic book covers shining under the lights. Her class was doing reports on Native Americans, and she had a whole bunch of feathers at home that she&#x2019;d collected from their family&#x2019;s camping trips. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be cool to make an actual headdress "May I have your attention please, ladies?" "I&#x2019;m Kathleen Winfrey," the lady was saying, "and I&#x2019;m here from the Rutledge Modeling Agency here in Burlington."</p><h2>Making Boxes and Chests: Techniques for Better Woodworking (The Workshop Companion)</h2><p>When you set out to build a box, a chest, or a cupboard, how do you join the case to make it as sturdy and stable as possible?

(Ages 5 to 9) <i>--Marcie Bovetz</i>For 30 years, <b>Jack Prelutsky</b>&#x2019;s inventive poems have inspired legions of children to fall in love with poetry. His outrageously silly poems have tickled even the most stubborn funny bones, while his darker verses have spooked countless late-night readers.

Surprisingly, Prelutsky developed a healthy dislike for poetry due to a teacher who &#x201c;left me with the impression that poetry was the literary equivalent of liver. I was told it was good for me, but I wasn&#x2019;t convinced.&#x201d; <br><br>In his early twenties, Prelutsky spent six months drawing imaginary animals in ink and watercolor. One evening, he wrote two dozen short poetry verses to accompany each drawing. A friend encouraged him to show them to an editor, who loved his poems (although not his artwork!) and urged him to keep writing. Prelutsky listened and he is still busy writing.<br>Jack Prelutsky lives on Mercer Island in Washington with his wife, Carolynn.</p><h2>Makepeace Experiment</h2><p>Lenny Makepeace uses magic and propaganda to lead Russia to a Marxist utopia.</p><p>Abram Tertz is the pseudonym of Andrei Sinyavsky, the exile Soviet dissident writer whose works have been compared to fabulists like Kafka and Borges.

"The most mesmerizing story of Abraham's life--his offering a son to God--plays a pivotal role in the holiest week of the Christian year, at Easter," writes Feiler. "The story is recited at the start of the holiest fortnight in Judaism, on Rosh Hashanah. The episode inspires the holiest day in Islam, '<i>Id al-Adha,</i>' the Feast of the Sacrifice, at the climax of the Pilgrimage. And yet the religions can't even agree on which son he tried to kill." Herein lies the irony and perfection of Feiler's timing. As we struggle to find a path to peace among these three religions, all warring in Jerusalem, near the stone where Abraham brought his son for sacrifice, this captivating biography speaks to Abraham as the metaphor he is: the historically elusive man who embodies three religions, a character who has shape-shifted over the millennia to serve the clashing goals and dogma of each religion.<p>Anyone seeking to understand the roots of tension in the Middle East need look no further than the final half of this book, where Feiler interprets the meaning of Abraham as seen through the prism of each religion. Surprisingly, the book is as entertaining as it is thoughtful: Feiler is a masterful writer with a warm, humorous voice, a dazzling way with metaphors, and an underlying intelligence that comes through in every passage. <i>Abraham</i> deserves the highest of recommendations. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Bruce Feiler is the author of Walking the Bible (Piatkus 2001), which the Washington Post described as &#34;an instant classic&#34;, and became an international bestseller.

Despite the government&#x2019;s official silence, news and panic spread throughout the USSR and Europe after the horrific accident.&nbsp;Like others, Yaroshinskaya initially fled with her family in hopes of escaping the danger from radioactive fallout that exceeded that of Hiroshima by three hundred times. When she returned home, she discovered that people in highly contaminated areas were being resettled in ones barely less contaminated, that their serious health problems were officially denied, and that people had to eat locally grown contaminated food.&nbsp;Her newspaper refused to publish her stories and instead commissioned another journalist to write more reassuring accounts. Finally, Isvestia published her articles. Despite official pressure, Yaroshinskaya was nominated overwhelmingly to the new parliament in 1989. This position gained her access to classified documents know as the Kremlin&#x2019;s "Forty Secret Protocols." Undaunted by threats, she revealed an official cover-up, including lies about "permissible" higher radioactive levels. Her courageous campaign won her the Right Livelihood Award in 1992.</p><p>Alla Yaroshinskaya is a member of President Yeltsin&#x2019;s Council and continues working as a journalist.

She has a tattoo, cuts her own hair, and has worn the same perfume since high school (Kiehl&#x2019;s Chinese Flowers).

Adam (but he doesn't count.)<br>Adam was this boy that I used to stare at in preschool. His hair was too long, that's why. It stuck out behind his ears and trailed down his neck, whereas all the other five-year-old boys had bowl haircuts. I didn't have too much hair myself--it didn't grow fast and my mom was always trimming it with her nail scissors--so I was a little obsessed with hair.<br><br>Adam's last name was Cox, and after I had been eyeing him for a couple of months, I named this stuffed bunny I had after him. All the grown-ups laughed when I said the bunny's name was Cox, and I didn't understand why.<br><br>Pretty soon, Adam and I were playing together. Our parents took us to the zoo, and we'd spend time after school in the nearby playground, drawing with chalk and walking up the slide. I remember we went swimming a few times at the YMCA, and hung out in a plastic wading pool in his backyard.

She didn't seem too impressed with my Adam Cox story. Or maybe it was the list itself she didn't think much of--though it had taken me a lot of work to do. I started the night after our first appointment, in bed in my pajamas, writing on this thick, cream-colored stationery my grandma Suzette got me. It says Ruby Denise Oliver on the top in this great curlicue font--but I never use it, since anyone I'd want to write to has e-mail.<br><br>My first draft, I only wrote down Jackson and Cabbie. Then I added Gideon at the beginning, with a question mark next to his name. Then Michael, the guy who was my first kiss--putting him in between Gideon and Jackson.<br><br>Then I turned off my light and tried to go to sleep.<br><br>No luck.<br><br>Well, I wasn't sleeping well lately anyway--but I lay there with this feeling that the list wasn't finished. I remembered that I'd told Doctor Z about Angelo already, so I turned the light back on and squeezed him in between Jackson and Cabbie.<br><br>Oh, and I had mentioned Noel to Doctor Z, too--though we were only friends. I stuck him in right after Jackson, just to have somewhere to put him. Then I rewrote the list in nice handwriting and managed to get myself to sleep--but in the middle of the night I woke up and wrote down two more boys and my History &amp; Politics teacher.<br><br>Then I crossed them all out.<br><br>At breakfast the next morning, I jumped up from my cereal bowl and put one of them back on.<br><br>At school, the hallway by the mail cubbies suddenly seemed like an obstacle course of old crushes and rejections.

Doctor Z wanted to know.<br><br>"I told you, I started a different school."<br><br>"Is there something more?" she said, looking at me over those red-rimmed glasses.<br><br>"No."<br><br>I had liked making the list, it was kind of fun.

Zoo trips with Adam Cox and his mom weren't exactly significant to my mental development.<br><br>Not that there was anything else I wanted to talk about.<br><br>I just wanted the panic attacks to stop.<br><br>And the hollow, sore feeling in my chest to go away.<br><br>And to feel like I could make it through lunch period without choking back tears.<br><br>And Jackson. I wanted Jackson back.<br><br>And my friends.<br><br>"Did you ever see him again?"<br><br>"Who?" I had forgotten what we were talking about.</p><h2>Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders</h2><p>Horace Rumpole - cigar-smoking, claret-drinking, Wordsworth-spouting defender of some unlikely clients - often speaks of the great murder trial which revealed his talents as an advocate and made his reputation down at the Bailey when he was still a young man. Now, for the first time, the sensational story of the Penge Bungalow Murders case is told in full: how, shortly after the war, Rumpole took on the seemingly impossible task of defending young Simon Jerold, accused of murdering his father and his father&#39;s friend with a German officer&#39;s gun. And how the inexperienced young brief was left alone to pursue the path of justice, in a case that was to echo through the Bailey for years to come.</p><p>John Mortimer is a novelist, playwright and former practising barrister. Among his many publications are several volumes of Rumpole stories and a trilogy of political novels (Paradise Postponed, Titmuss Regained and The Sound of Trumpets) featuring Leslie Titmuss - a character as brilliant as Rumpole. John Mortimer received a knighthood for his services to the arts in 1998.Bill Wallis is brilliant as Horace Rumpole, the cantankerous hero of 12 volumes of Mortimer's Wodehousian accounts of life at the Old Bailey. In this entry, Rumpole is writing his memoirs about his long and irreverent career, beginning with his first case, the Penge Bungalow murders. (This is also the case that brought him to the attention of Hilda, aka, "She who must be obeyed.") Wallis's Rumpole sounds just as he should as he narrates his memoir: gruff, wistful, funny, sly, and infuriatingly lovable. Fans of the BBC-TV series will be pleased to learn that he sounds much like its star, Leo McKern, without trying to be a carbon copy. Wallis is also word-perfect with the wild assortment of secondary characters, from members of the British legal profession (who range from loopy to pompous) to Hilda's refined friends to the denizens of the witness box. Listeners will be sorely tempted to listen to this in one sitting and will be disappointed when it ends. R.E.K.

He is the author of five previous books, including <b>The Book on Bush</b> (with Mark Green), <b>What Liberal Media?</b> and <b>Sound and Fury</b>.</p>Alterman, journalist and proud liberal, readies his readership for the coming day when the word liberal is given a wash and rinse after being slimed by conservatives. Arguing that liberals are so downtrodden they may have forgotten who they are, Alterman provides a refresher course, explaining what liberals believe and why liberal policies are reviled, even though most people approve of their basic ideas as long as they aren&#x2019;t identified as liberal. His insightful examination of so-called liberal problems (secularism, abortion, dovish foreign policy) leads into an extensive and sharp rebuttal of all the crimes attributed to liberals. In ironically entitled chapters&#x2014;&#x201c;Why Do Liberals Hate Patriotism?&#x201d; &#x201c;Why Do Liberals Blame America First?&#x201d;&#x2014;Alterman fights back with facts and wit. He busts myths in &#x201c;Why Do Liberals Deny America Was Founded as a Christian Nation?&#x201d; but he owns up to the fact that liberals do like to tax and spend (conservatives do, too, just on different things). Readers of Alterman&#x2019;s What Liberal Media? (2003) will find some familiar points here, but this rock-&#x2019;em, sock-&#x2019;em defense effectively proves that not all liberals are wimps. --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>Dr.No</h2><p>M called this case a soft option.

HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR</b></p> <p>Punctually at six o'clock the sun set with a last yellow flash behind the Blue Mountains, a wave of violet shadow poured down Richmond Road, and the crickets and tree frogs in the fine gardens began to zing and tinkle.</p> <p>Apart from the background noise of the insects, the wide empty street was quiet. The wealthy owners of the big, withdrawn houses&#x2014;the bank managers, company directors and top civil servants&#x2014;had been home since five o'clock and they would be discussing the day with their wives or taking a shower and changing their clothes. In half an hour the street would come to life again with the cocktail traffic, but now this very superior half mile of' Rich Road', as it was known to the tradesmen of Kingston, held nothing but the suspense of an empty stage and the heavy perfume of night-scented jasmine.</p> <p>Richmond Road is the 'best' road in all Jamaica. It is Jamaica's Park Avenue, its Kensington Palace Gardens, its Avenue D'lena. The 'best' people live in its big old-fashioned houses, each in an acre or two of beautiful lawn set, too trimly, with the finest trees and flowers from the Botanical Gardens at Hope. The long, straight road is cool and quiet and withdrawn from the hot, vulgar sprawl of Kingston where its residents earn their money, and, on the other side of the T-intersection at its top, lie the grounds of King's House, where the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Jamaica lives with his family. In Jamaica, no road could have a finer ending.</p> <p>On the eastern corner of the top intersection stands No 1 Richmond Road, a substantial two-storey house with broad white-painted verandas running round both floors. From the road a gravel path leads up to the pillared entrance through wide lawns marked out with tennis courts on which this evening, as on all evenings, the sprinklers are at work. This mansion is the social Mecca of Kingston. It is Queen's Club, which, for fifty years, has boasted the power and frequency of its black-balls.</p> <p>Such stubborn retreats will not long survive in modern Jamaica. One day Queen's Club will have its windows smashed and perhaps be burned to the ground, but for the time being it is a useful place to find in a sub-tropical island&#x2014;well run, well staffed and with the finest cuisine and cellar in the Caribbean.</p> <p>At that time of day, on most evenings of the year, you would find the same four motor cars standing in the road outside the club. They were the cars belonging to the high bridge game that assembled punctually at five and played until around midnight. You could almost set your watch by these cars. They belonged, reading from the order in which they now stood against the kerb, to the Brigadier in command of the Caribbean Defence Force, to Kingston's leading criminal lawyer, and to the Mathematics Professor from Kingston University. At the tail of the line stood the black Sunbeam Alpine of Commander John Strangways, RN (Ret.), Regional Control Officer for the Caribbean&#x2014;or, less discreetly, the local representative of the British Secret Service.</p> <p>Just before six-fifteen, the silence of Richmond Road was softly broken. Three blind beggars came round the corner of the intersection and moved slowly down the pavement towards the four cars. They were Chigroes&#x2014;Chinese Negroes&#x2014;bulky men, but bowed as they shuffled along, tapping at the kerb with their white sticks. They walked in file. The first man, who wore blue glasses and could presumably see better than the others, walked in front holding a tin cup against the crook of the stick in his left hand. The right hand of the second man rested on his shoulder and the right hand of the third on the shoulder of the second. The eyes of the second and third men were shut. The three men were dressed in rags and wore dirty jippa-jappa baseball caps with long peaks. They said nothing and no noise came from them except the soft tapping of their sticks as they came slowly down the shadowed pavement towards the group of cars.</p> <p>The three blind men would not have been incongruous in Kingston, where there are many diseased people on the streets, but, in this quiet rich empty street, they made an unpleasant impression. And it was odd that they should all be Chinese Negroes. This is not a common mixture of bloods.</p> <p>In the cardroom, the sunburned hand reached out into the green pool of the centre table and gathered up the four cards. There was a quiet snap as the trick went to join the rest. 'Hundred honours,' said Strangways, 'and ninety below!' He looked at his watch and stood up. 'Back in twenty minutes. Your deal. Bill. Order some drinks. Usual for me. Don't bother to cook a hand for me while I'm gone. I always spot them.'</p> <p>Bill Templar, the Brigadier, laughed shortly. He pinged the bell by his side and raked the cards in towards him. He said,' Hurry up, blast you. You always let the cards go cold just as your partner's in the money.'</p> <p>Strangways was already out of the door. The three men sat back resignedly in their chairs. The coloured steward came in and they ordered drinks for themselves and a whisky and water for Strangways.</p> <p>There was this maddening interruption every evening at six fifteen, about halfway through their second rubber. At this time precisely, even if they were in the middle of a hand, Strangways had to go to his 'office' and 'make a call'. It was a damned nuisance. But Strangways was a vital part of their four and they put up with it. It was never explained what 'the call' was, and no one asked. Strangways's job was 'hush' and that was that. He was rarely away for more than twenty minutes and it was understood that he paid for his absence with a round of drinks.</p> <p>The drinks came and the three men began to talk racing. In fact, this was the most important moment in Strangways's day&#x2014;the time of his duty radio contact with the powerful transmitter on the roof of the building in Regent's Park that is the headquarters of the Secret Service. Every day, at eighteen-thirty local time, unless he gave warning the day before that he would not be on the air&#x2014;when he had business on one of the other islands in his territory, for instance, or was seriously ill&#x2014;he would transmit his daily report and receive his orders. If he failed to come on the air precisely at six-thirty, there would be a second call, the 'Blue' call, at seven, and, finally, the 'Red' call at seven-thirty. After this, if his transmitter remained silent, it was 'Emergency', and Section III, his controlling authority in London, would urgently get on the job of finding out what had happened to him.</p> <p>Even a 'Blue' call means a bad mark for an agent unless his 'Reasons in Writing' are unanswerable. London's radio schedules round the world are desperately tight and their minute disruption by even one extra call is a dangerous nuisance. Strangways had never suffered the ignominy of a 'Blue' call, let alone a 'Red', and was as certain as could be that he never would do so. Every evening, at precisely six-fifteen, he left Queen's Club, got into his car and drove for ten minutes up into the foothills of the Blue Mountains to his neat bungalow with the fabulous view over Kingston harbour. At six twenty-five he walked through the hall to the office at the back. He unlocked the door and locked it again behind him. Miss Trueblood, who passed as his secretary, but was in fact his No. 2 and a former Chief Officer WRNS, would already be sitting in front of the dials inside the dummy filing cabinet. She would have the earphones on and would be making first contact, tapping out his call-sign, WXN, on 14 megacycles. There would be a shorthand pad on her elegant knees. Strangways would drop into the chair beside her and pick up the other pair of head-phones and, at exactly six twenty-eight, he would take over from her and wait for the sudden hollowness in the ether that meant that WWW in London was coming in to acknowledge.</p> <p>It was an iron routine. Strangways was a man of iron routine. Unfortunately, strict patterns of behaviour can be deadly if they are read by an enemy. Strangways, a tall lean man with a black patch over the right eye and the sort of aquiline good looks you associate with the bridge of a destroyer, walked quickly across the mahogany panelled hallway of Queen's Club and pushed through the light mosquito-wired doors and ran down the three steps to the path.</p> <p>There was nothing very much on his mind except the sensual pleasure of the clean fresh evening air and the memory of the finesse that had given him his three spades. There was this case, of course, the case he was working on, a curious and complicated affair that M had rather nonchalantly tossed over the air at him two weeks earlier. But it was going well. A chance lead into the Chinese community had paid off. Some odd angles had come to light - for the present the merest shadows of angles - but if they jelled, thought Strangways as he strode down the gravel path and into Richmond Road, he might find himself involved in something very odd indeed.</p> <p>Strangways shrugged his shoulders. Of course it wouldn't turn out like that. The fantastic never materialised in his line of business. There would be some drab solution that had been embroidered by overheated imaginations and the usual hysteria of the Chinese.</p> <p>Automatically, another part of Strangways's mind took in the three blind men. They were tapping slowly towards him down the sidewalk. They were about twenty yards away. He calculated that they would pass him a second or two before he reached his car. Out of shame for his own health and gratitude for it, Strangways felt for a coin. He ran his thumbnail down its edge to make sure it was a florin and not a penny. He took it out. He was parallel with the beggars. How odd, they were all Chigroes! How very odd! Strangways's hand went out. The coin clanged in the tin cup.</p> <p>'Bless you. Master,' said the leading man. 'Bless you,' echoed the other two.</p> <p>The car key was in Strangways's hand. Vaguely he registered the...</p></p><h2>Kris Longknife: Defender</h2><p>Kris Longknife is back in the good graces of the brass&#x2014;and to demonstrate that, they've promoted her to Admiral.&nbsp; Now her mission is to find the home base of the space pirates who are plaguing the fringes of the galaxy.<br>&nbsp;<br>But no mission is ever simple when your name is Longknife. And this time the complications range from the military to the personal, as Kris finds herself&#x2014;reluctantly&#x2014;having to make some command decisions about her future...</p><p><b>Mike Shepherd </b>is a pseudonym for Mike Moscoe. Moscoe is a full-time writer who lives in the Pacific Northwest.&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what was gonna attack Alwa?&#x201d; Granny Rita said. Once commodore of BatCruRon 16, she&#x2019;d fought hopeless battles. Still, her voice held dismay as she surveyed the wreckage of the alien base ship.<p>&#x201c;It was about twice that size before we took some bites out of it,&#x201d; Lieutenant Commander, Her Royal Highness, Kris Longknife said. Herself no stranger to hopeless battles, she added, &#x201c;And we&#x2019;re still quite a ways off. It will get bigger.&#x201d;</p><p>Rita Nuu Longknife Ponsa, former captain of the Battlecruiser Furious, was the recognized leader of the humans, and uniformly called Granny Rita by both the heavy ones, us humans, and the indigenous inhabitants of Alwa, who named themselves either the People, or the Light People.</p><p>Granny Rita turned to translate for the delegation of six Alwans who had come to see for all the unbelievable story Kris had told their Association of Associations.</p><p>Privately, Granny Rita called the assembly &#x201c;the flock of flocks,&#x201d; but she&#x2019;d warned Kris never to say that where any Alwan might overhear.</p><p>Kris listened as Granny Rita and the Alwans clicked and cooed with maybe one word in five sounding familiar to Kris. It was a pigeon dialect they&#x2019;d worked out over eighty years.</p><p>However, Nelly, Kris&#x2019;s not-very-personable computer, was working on a translator for the two peoples. Kris wondered if the peace that had held for the last eighty years between the Alwans and the humans might have been helped along by both sides&#x2019; not fully understanding what the other side said.</p><p>When Nelly finished this effort, Kris would have to have a talk with her.</p><p>The six Alwans&#x2019; movements were quick, almost jerky, as they moved around the forward lounge. Their arms and hands waved. Kris had a feeling that a couple of million years earlier, the flock would have taken flight at this news. Now, having given up most of their feathers as well as flight, they formed and re-formed groups of two or three, talking among themselves and rarely glancing at the view screen that showed the battered alien-invasion base.</p><p>This meeting was not being held on the USS Wasp&#x2019;s bridge. The Alwans had taken in the intensity of the bridge crew at their work and immediately expressed distress to Granny Rita. Kris had offered instead the Forward Lounge, with its four huge screens. Since Kris&#x2019;s staff were all equipped with Nelly or one of her children, Kris was confident they could do anything that needed doing while letting the Alwans take in the familiar activities of humans eating, drinking, and, in general, enjoying themselves in the familiar surroundings of a restaurant.</p><p>And now, thanks to the magic of Katsu&#x2019;s wizardry with Smart MetalTM, Kris was able to separate the restaurant from her transferred Tac Center with a transparent wall. Yep, Katsu-san could make Smart MetalTM clear as glass!</p><p>Kris missed him already, but Katsu said he had trained the Wasp&#x2019;s ship maintainers as well as he could. He wanted to get back to Musashi and his job at Mitsubishi Heavy Space Industry; his head was already full of ideas for making the next class of ships even better. Thus buzzing with new ideas, he joined the IMS Sakura for the long voyage back to human space.</p><p>Kris hated the idea that the Wasp was all by itself clear on the other side of the galaxy. Still, there was no question folks back home needed to know that the sacrifice of their Fleet of Discovery had saved the world they fought for. Even more, the strange planet they laid down their lives for had provided a home to a desperate group of humans. Now, eighty years later, it sheltered a growing human colony.</p><p>That colony was led by the former wife of King Raymond of United Society (or United Societies depending on how you thought the new constitution should be interpreted). Problem was, she had buried two husbands in the last eighty years on Alwa and was now mother to seven, grandmother to thirty-four, and great-grandmother to at least 123. That number was subject to change . . . often.</p><p>Kris herself was included among the great-grandchildren and had spent a full week meeting a big chunk of half uncles, aunts, and cousins. Still, to one and all of the humans on Alwa, related or not, the former commodore was Granny Rita.</p><p>Surprises on top of surprises. Kris could only wonder how the news carried by the IMS Sakura would be received.</p><p>But for now, she had no time for Longknife family matters; a huge alien mother ship loomed larger and larger on their screens. Now the Alwans seemed mesmerized by its promise of death. They huddled before the screen, eyes locked on it, only occasionally whispering something low.</p><p>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t good,&#x201d; Granny Rita whispered to Kris. &#x201c;Once or twice, I&#x2019;ve seen one group of them resort to confrontation to settle differences. When one side is fully intimidated by the others&#x2019; show of force, the weaker side just hunkers down and surrenders. These folks don&#x2019;t fight. If you can strut yourself a good enough show, you win.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you get across to them that a couple of human ships smaller than this one chewed that monster up pretty good and only spit out this much?&#x201d; Kris said.</p><p>Granny shrugged. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve walked this ship. They know its measure. That . . .?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe we should have shown them the two Hellburners we have amidships?&#x201d; Jack said. He was her chief of security, skipper of a rump battalion of Marines composed of a reinforced Wardhaven Marine company and a borrowed, and equally reinforced Musashi Marine company.</p><p>For all too brief a time, they&#x2019;d managed to be lovers.</p><p>At the time, they were fugitives and Jack not in Kris&#x2019;s chain of command.</p><p>Now Kris was back on the new Wasp and Jack was keeping her safe and both of them were keeping doors open whenever it was just the two of them alone.</p><p>Simply put, Navy regs on fraternization sucked bilgewater . . . through a straw. But Kris and Jack wore the uniform and followed the regulations.</p><p>Kris shook her head. &#x201c;The Hellfire missiles look pretty tiny.&#x201d; Though the few cubic millimeters of neutron-star material weighed fifteen thousand tons, it was hard for anyone who hadn&#x2019;t seen them in action to believe how destructive they were.</p><p>Again, Granny shook her head. &#x201c;These folks have theater. They really enjoy a show, but their media is just for what is happening now. They do not record their history. Yes, some plays are historically based, but they really don&#x2019;t have any concept of either battle, like you showed us, or of recording it for later review.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t going over all that well, is it?&#x201d; said Penny. Kris&#x2019;s chief of intelligence, she also stood double duty on the bridge at Defensive Systems. On a ship that could convert your spacious stateroom into a footlocker and send the extra Smart MetalTM to armor the ship&#x2019;s hide, it was a critical battle station.</p><p>Kris&#x2019;s usual battle station, Weapons, was next to Penny&#x2019;s, putting the enemy in the crosshairs of the Wasp&#x2019;s destructive lasers. For the new Wasp, those included four long 18-inch laser rifles, usually reserved for a battleship. The Weapons Division was still looking for a chance to show what they could do.</p><p>Everyone else on the Wasp was fervently hoping the Weapons Division would continue polishing their guns and wondering what they could do. The Wasp was as far from human space as a ship could get.</p><p>She was also very alone now that the Sakura was gone.</p><p>Being far from any repair facilities and any help was no time to go looking for a fight.</p><p>On this, Kris and her entire staff agreed.</p><p>But they did want to know what kind of damage they&#x2019;d done to the alien raider&#x2019;s base ship. Just how good were the Hellburners at doing bad?</p><p>Inquiring minds wanted to know.</p><p>But carefully. Very carefully.</p><p>&#x201c;Nelly, how far has the hulk drifted from the jump point it was just out of when we hit it?&#x201d; Kris asked her personal computer. Nelly was much upgraded from the day she&#x2019;d been given to the little girl Kris before she started school. Nelly was now worth at least half the value of the USS Wasp. Nelly had condescended to give the Mitsubishi Heavy Space Industry&#x2019;s Chief Engineer, Katsu, one of Nelly&#x2019;s kids. This had made up for the other half of the frigate&#x2019;s cost not covered by bake sales and donations from the schoolchildren of Musashi.</p><p>&#x201c;She was accelerating away from the jump point,&#x201d; Nelly said, &#x201c;at about half a gee. Then we hit her hard in the rump, and that must have accelerated her more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I agree with that,&#x201d; said Captain Drago, from the bridge. Hired by the Wardhaven Intelligence Service to captain the Wasp under a contract that had more to do with King Ray wanting to somehow save Kris from making all of the worst mistakes he&#x2019;d made as a junior officer, Drago hadn&#x2019;t kept Kris from taking on the giant planet murderer that tumbled and rolled in front of them.</p><p>Old men&#x2019;s plans for young people don&#x2019;t always work out as planned.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain,&#x201d; Kris said, &#x201c;you can call me paranoid, but I&#x2019;d like to approach the hulk, keeping it between us and anything that might suddenly pop out of that jump.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Paranoia has kept a lot of Longknifes alive,&#x201d; Granny Rita said.</p><p>&#x201c;Adjusting course,&#x201d; Captain Drago said.</p><p>&#x201c;Nelly, how much of the Wasp&#x2019;s Smart Metal do you want to use for explorer nanos?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As much as Penny will let me, Kris. I&#x2019;ll be controlling them with all the self-organizing matrix that I haven&#x2019;t yet used for my next child.&#x201d; In half payment on the Wasp, Nelly had swapped one kid to Katsu, with solid overrides if he, or his father, should ever try to duplicate her child. Having lived with Kris for twenty years, Nelly came by her paranoia honestly. Nelly&#x2019;s price for that one had been enough matrix to birth three more children to replace those lost on the long, dangerous flight from this battle.</p><p>She&#x2019;d only granted two of the new personnel on the Wasp the honor of working with one of her children. That left one child yet unborn. Nelly was willing to divide that matrix up and share it out among the exploration drones to give them top-notch guidance and sensor suites to study the hulk.</p><p>That still left the basic question: How much Smart MetalTM would there be for her matrix to fly?</p><p>Penny took a while to talk to Mimzy, her own computer and one of Nelly&#x2019;s offspring. &#x201c;Kris, I&#x2019;d like to shrink the Wasp down to Condition Baker.&#x201d;</p><p>Under Baker, the &#x201c;love boat&#x201d; proportions of Condition Able became a bit constrained. Passageways got narrower. Unused spaces shrunk or vanished. The reaction-mass tanks that had given up a part of their contents on the way out here would be resized. All that spare metal would be moved to the outer hull of the Wasp to form a reflective surface and a honeycomb through which cool reaction mass flowed. This sandwich of armor should protect the Wasp from laser hits as good as, if not better than, the six-meter-thick ice armor on heavy battleships.</p><p>&#x201c;I concur,&#x201d; Captain Drago said. This meeting with the Alwans might not be taking place on the bridge, but clearly he was following it very closely.</p><p>He was, after all, the captain.</p><p>&#x201c;Mimzy,&#x201d; Penny said, &#x201c;announce to all hands that we will be going to Condition Baker in one minute and that we may go to Condition Charlie without further notice.&#x201d; Charlie was worse than Baker, but not as bad as Condition Zed. When Zed was ordered, people&#x2019;s quarters were compressed down into a few lockers, and the entire rest of the room vanished. The same went for the scientist&#x2019;s research labs.</p><p>Boffins had complained loudly about Condition Zed. The scientists had been shown the fine print in their contracts and reminded that they were all subject to activation as reserve officers, and as such, would follow the proper orders of their duly appointed superiors.</p><p>The scientists complained, but they knew it wouldn&#x2019;t matter if ever Captain Drago, Kris, or Penny ordered Condition Zed.</p><p>Around Kris, the Forward Lounge began to shrink. Empty tables melted into the deck. Folks in the middle of their dinner found their table and chairs moving closer together as empty places vanished away.</p><p>All hands went through this drill once a week for Baker and once a month for Zed. Folks kept right on eating, drinking, and when a new couple came in, the lounge expanded to provide them a table.</p><p>The Alwans were still fixated on the wreck ahead; they failed to notice what was happening around them.</p><p>&#x201c;Princess, my boffins have noticed something strange about the wreck,&#x201d; came in the calm, aristocratic voice of Professor Joao Labao. He was on sabbatical from the University of Braz�lia and the senior administrator of the 250 scientists aboard the Wasp and the reason the frigate could honestly claim to be a research ship. &#x201c;Have your examinations identified anything different between the right and left sides of the aft end of the hulk?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a negative,&#x201d; came from Senior Chief Beni. He&#x2019;d come out of retirement to have &#x201c;a shot at them that killed my kid.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting no radio readings from that hulk. The reactors are dead. Anywhere you look on the electromagnetic spectrum or radioactive scale, she&#x2019;s as dead as Caesar&#x2019;s ghost.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would most certainly agree with you, Chief,&#x201d; the professor said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s our optics that are giving us cause for second thoughts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pass them through to me in the Forward Lounge,&#x201d; Kris said.</p><p>&#x201c;And me on the bridge,&#x201d; the skipper spoke over Kris.</p><p>The rolling, tumbling hulk had been getting closer. Now, using the powerful optical instruments usually reserved for deep-space research, the aft end of the blasted wreck jumped into clear definition.</p><p>Bits of hull and I-beams were twisted like a child&#x2019;s strand of candy. Other thick hull strength members were nearly broken through. Some hung by a thread and did their own dance as the ship waddled through space.</p><p>&#x201c;We hit it hard,&#x201d; Kris muttered.</p><p>The Alwans had broken from their fixation on the huge ship and now were once again moving quickly among themselves, talking rapidly.</p><p>&#x201c;I think,&#x201d; said Granny Rita, &#x201c;they are now very impressed with what you can do.&#x201d;</p><p>That was good because the picture then changed.</p><p>The professor took up the narration. &#x201c;What you were looking at was the left end of the aft quarter, portside aft to you Sailors. What you&#x2019;re now seeing is the right side, starboard aft quarter. Notice the difference.&#x201d;</p><p>There was still clear evidence of damage. But many of the beams that had looked knocked about like jackstraws on the other side, were gone. The picture zoomed in further.</p><p>&#x201c;We think someone has been cutting away at that wreckage with laser welding torches. We&#x2019;ll need to get in closer. Have nanos take a good look at the cuts, but that side of the ship does not look like we left it, of that I am sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All hands, battle stations,&#x201d; Captain Drago&#x2019;s voice announced on the 1MC. &#x201c;All weapons, report when you are manned and ready.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Kandoo Kangaroo Hops into Homeschool</h2><p>A mother kangaroo realizes that her six-year-old is ready to start home schooling.</p><p>A great children's book for those who homeschool, those thinking about homeschooling, or those who like entertaining children's books.

Unfortunately, the private lives of actors such as John Wayne, Henry Fonda, and Errol Flynn rarely lived up to the idealistic roles they portrayed. However, James Stewart was known as the underdog fighter in many of his films and in real life. He was highly decorated for his bravery during his time as a bomber pilot during World War II and was adored for his earnest and kindly persona.<br><br>Here many unknown sides of Stewart are revealed: his explosive temper, his complex love affairs, his service as a secret agent for the FBI, his innate shyness, and his passionate patriotism. Munn&#x2019;s personal touch shines through his writing, as he was a friend of Stewart and his wife, Gloria, and interviewed them as well as their colleagues and friends. This definitive biography reveals the childhood ups and downs that formed this cinema hero, explores the legendary Fonda&#x2013;Stewart relationship, and recounts Stewart&#x2019;s experiences making acclaimed films that include The Philadelphia Story, Rear Window, Anatomy of a Murder, It&#x2019;s a Wonderful Life, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.</p><p><strong> Michael Munn</strong> is a film historian and the author of twenty-five books, including Stars at War, The Hollywood Connection, and the bestseller John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth. As a journalist he has written extensively on cinema, crime, ancient history, and the World War Two. He lives in Suffolk, England. &nbsp;<br>Ask a younger audience about Gary Cooper or Spencer Tracy, and you might get a blank stare. Jimmy Stewart, thanks to It&#x2019;s a Wonderful Life, hasn&#x2019;t suffered the same fate. Stewart&#x2019;s fans are in for a treat with this anecdote-filled biography, which features a major bombshell: for years, Stewart provided undercover reports to the FBI&#x2019;s J. Edgar Hoover. Among the nuggets mined here: the rift over politics between conservative Stewart and his liberal best friend, Henry Fonda; Stewart being tempted by Grace Kelly; and how Stewart wanted to help Hoover rout the Mafia from Hollywood but ended up naming Communists. Unfortunately, these revelations and the text as a whole could have been better documented. Appended is a list of sources, but as Munn, a friend of both Stewart and Stewart&#x2019;s wife, Gloria, testifies, it&#x2019;s limited to &#x201c;who I&#x2019;ve quoted . . . along with the year (as best I can remember it)&#x201d; and the location. Much of the information comes from phone calls and social chats with Gloria Stewart. Did Munn really write everything down? Still, shaky bona fides aside, this a fun Old Hollywood bio. --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>Songs of Childhood</h2><p>A collection of forty-seven poems about subjects and experiences familiar to children.</p><p></p><h2>Hide and Snake</h2><p>In this amusing picture book, a colorful snake challenges children to find him as he slithers through pages of familiar objects. &#x201c;Baker&#x2019;s elaborate acrylic designs, variety of lush hues, and sly wit provide a feast for the eyes while maintaining the cohesive personality of the book from page to page.&#x201d;--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br></p><p><b>Keith Baker</b> has written and illustrated many well-loved picture books and early chapter books, including several about&nbsp;the charming and lovable Mr. and Mrs. Green. Two of his best-known picture books, <i>Hide and Snake </i>and <i>Who Is the Beast?,</i>&nbsp;are about animals.&nbsp;He lives in Seattle, Washington.A vibrantly striped snake plays hide-and-seek in an array of imaginative locations. He starts off ("Ready or not--here I go!") easily concealing himself among mittens and balls of yarn, then around elaborate hats, a pile of lavishly wrapped presents and napping cats. The spare but engaging verse relates this crafty creature's continueing journey: "I'm frosting the cakes, / ticking with clocks, / melting in ice cream, / and sliding through socks." The socks present perhaps the greatest test to the reader, but generally the same thing gives the elusive reptile away throughout: one round eyeball and a smug smile. In the end, he tricks even the most astute snake-finder with his garden hose ploy. Though simple in concept, this book provides a diverting, entertaining challenge that youngsters will relish.

Such is the wonderful writing debut of acclaimed actor B.D. Wong.</p><p>With a remarkable mixture of upbeat optimism, unexpected hilarity, and heart-wrenching sadness, Wong takes the reader deep inside both his psyche and the neonatal intensive care unit where he spent the better part of three months following the harrowing medical twists and turns that took place after the premature birth of his twins."Once upon a time," as Wong explains in his true story, <em>Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of the Chestnut Man)</em>, "my partner and I found ourselves expecting, with the help of a surrogate mother, modern medical science, and lots of good luck and prayers. To add to our blessing, she was carrying twins! Things were pretty swell ... until the twins arrived almost three months early. For those of you who don't know, babies that come almost three months early are pretty little, and boy are they scary-looking. Especially when you're their dad ... " </p><p>Originally based on a series of real-time E-mails sent to keep his friends and family abreast of the daily madness and miracles of "early" parenthood, this book is a gem, a joy, and an inspiration to anyone who has ever taken a ride on the roller coaster of life and tried to keep both sense of humor and sanity intact.</p></p><p>High tech meets high touch in actor B.D. Wong&#x2019;s remarkable electronic parenting memoir, <i>Following Foo</i> The story begins when the surrogate mother, carrying twins for Wong and longtime partner Richie, gives birth 11 weeks early. The loss of the first twin and the anguished nurturing of the tiny Foo are described in a series of e-mails for friends, family and theatrical colleagues, whose responses are also reprinted. Readers ride the roller coaster of Foo&#x2019;s surgeries, eye exams, pneumonia scares, dropping heart rate, and brochospasms. Although Wong is writing about a unique situation, he manages to capture the fear and awe that every parent will recognize.<p> Wong&#x2019;s wiry alertness, sly show-business humor, and aching vulnerability are a potent mix. In one e-mail, he captures the terror and tenderness of the intensive-care nursery. In another, he celebrates Foo&#x2019;s first, long- awaited "poop." He overeats, describes his parents in loving detail, and leaves the door of a hospital refrigerator (packed with frozen breast milk) wide open. The author&#x2019;s voice crackles with love, energy and astute observation. Occasionally his essays--for example, one written from baby Foo&#x2019;s perspective--seem forced. Also, the decision to include the name-dropping "credits" of the friends who responded to his e-mails mar this otherwise exceptional tale. Still, these don't obscure the book's charms. Early in the book, Wong compares his newborn son to "a little chestnut man&#x2014;a wise old man selling chestnuts on a snowy night." By the book&#x2019;s end, it is Wong&#x2019;s hard-won wisdom that will warm readers. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i></p><p>B. D. Wong made his Broadway debut in <em>M. Butterfly</em>.

He was eighty-two at the time and the flight represented the culmination of a dream he'd cultivated since his childhood in the 1930s.<br><br>Eileen Bjorkman &#x2015; herself a pilot and aeronautical engineer &#x2015; frames her father's journey from teenage airplane enthusiast to Air Force pilot and Boeing engineer in the context of the rise, near extermination, and ongoing interest in homebuilt aircraft in the United States. She gives us a glimpse into life growing up in a "flying family" with two pilots for parents, a family plane named Charlie, and quite literally, a propeller under her parents' bed.<br><br>From early airplane designs serialized in magazines to the annual Oshkosh Fly-in where you can see experimental aircraft on display, Bjorkman offers a personal take on the history of building something in your garage that you can actually (and legally) fly as well as how the homebuilt aircraft movement has contributed to aviation and innovation in America.<br><br>Watch the book trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8PvowEMkmQ</p><p><p>On July 25, 2010, Eileen Bjorkman's 82-year-old father, Arnold Ebneter, took off from Paine Field in Everett, Washington, to set an aviation world record in an airplane he designed himself and built in his garage in Woodinville, Washington. The 2,300-mile non-stop flight took the retired Air Force pilot and Boeing engineer eighteen hours, but the preparation took fifty years. A curiosity and aviation sideshow at one time, homebuilt aircraft now make up about one in five small, privately-owned aircraft in the United States. With contributions that include fabric covering systems, sturdy landing gears, and affordable avionics, homebuilt aircraft are a small but ever-growing part of aviation's DNA.Bjorkman uses her background as a pilot, would-be homebuilder, and aeronautical engineer to intertwine the century-long history and culture of homebuilt aircraft in the United States with Ebneter's fifty-year struggle to build his airplane. Along the way lay tales of derring-do pioneers and their fragile craft that could barely become airborne to visionaries that kept homebuilding freedoms alive in the 1940s and modern homebuilts that rival and even surpass the performance and quality of factory-built aircraft.In addition to the narrative, the book provides a non-technical window into the world of aircraft design and construction: What's involved in designing an airplane? How do you assemble a kit airplane? How have airplane designs evolved? Why would anyone want to build an airplane, instead of just buying one? The book may also be useful as a supplementary text for a first class in aircraft design.</p><b>Eileen Bjorkman</b> is a writer, pilot, and retired U.S. Air Force flight test engineer.</p><h2>Cold Storage, Alaska (A Cold Storage Novel)</h2><p><p><b>An offbeat, often hilarious crime novel set in the sleepy Alaskan town of Cold Storage from the Shamus Award winning author of the Cecil Younger series. </b><br> &nbsp;<br> Cold Storage, Alaska, is a remote fishing outpost where salmonberries sparkle in the morning frost and where you just might catch a King Salmon if you&#x2019;re zen enough to wait for it.

He received a BA in English from the University of Washington and, at the urging of his parents, a certificate of completion in horse shoeing. John never saw himself living in Alaska (where there are no horses left to shoe), but when his wife, Jan, a prominent whale biologist, announced she was taking a job in Sitka, the two headed north and never left. John worked for thirty years as a criminal defense investigator in Sitka, and many of the characters that fill his books were inspired by his work. Now retired, he lives with his wife in a bright green house on the beach and writes in his weather-tight office overlooking Old Sitka Rocks.

Now it was whistling, yet she didn&#x2019;t get up to attend to it. Recently the past had become a hallucination that seemed to be intruding into the present moment, so she wasn&#x2019;t certain what really needed doing. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had been thinking about Franklin Roosevelt: the grinning man with the cigarette holder, who was never photographed in his frailty. But now it was early spring in the last year of Bill Clinton&#x2019;s presidency, and all the news was about the President&#x2019;s failings. Flawed men kept ruling the world and the radio in the corner with the long antennae squealed on and on about it. Not that the news mattered much to Annabelle now. It was raining hard and all of the events of her life&#x2014;past, present, and possibly the future&#x2014;were taking on the quality of a slightly malevolent screwball comedy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sat in her chair looking out the window. She had been distracted by so many things lately, presidents, family members, and lost animals all swirling around her. The glass on the door rattled, and she looked up expecting to see her uncle, Slippery Wilson, walk in slapping his wet leather gloves against his pants, even though Slippery Wilson had been dead for more than three decades. She found herself listening for crying from the crib, even though both her boys were grown men. The older one, Miles, was down at the Senior Center cooking dinner, and Clive was getting out of prison.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Never matter,&#x201d; Annabelle said aloud to herself. She got up and turned off the radio in the corner. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Periodically during the afternoon she had been trying to remember the joke she had heard the day before, and she tried again now. It was good, she remembered, and she thought that it would have been good to tell Miles. But the joke, like most of the details of the New Deal, eluded her in its detail.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out her window the hillside fell away to the inlet. Alder trees grew quickly on the disturbed ground where the boys had built her house. A gust of wind came, and she thought she saw some darting color. A flash of yellow&#x2014;she couldn&#x2019;t be sure, but it seemed like a match head exploding. Yellow with red sparks flaring in the trees. She slid her glasses up her nose and was almost certain that she saw the bird fluttering up and away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Buddy?&#x201d; she said aloud, as the kettle boiled over and doused the flame.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the day he was released from prison, Clive Cahon was thinking about his plan to get home. He had called ahead to order a cab. He didn&#x2019;t know why he gave the cab company a false name; it was simply the first name that popped into his head and had nothing at all to do with the plan. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had hated living in Alaska as a kid. His father had assumed he would become a fisherman. His mother had assumed that no matter how he made his living, it would be made right there in Cold Storage. Only his grandma Ellie had told him not to listen and to dream his own dreams. Having grown up on an island on the north Pacific Clive had longed for the great American Highway. He dreamed of cars and deserts, and long straight roads. Ellie had always given him books about cars, for every birthday and Christmas; cars and guitars, bands he heard on the radio and beautiful girls who didn&#x2019;t know everything about him. Ellie had understood his itch to move on. Only she seemed to understand that living in Cold Storage, Alaska, was like being born into a small maze, where everyone constantly bumped into one another. As soon as his father died in the Thanksgiving Day storm, Clive had left. He had flown north to Hanes, bought a car, without ever owning a license, without ever learning to drive, and he took off. He was fifteen. Ellie&#x2019;s ashes had been scattered at sea and his father&#x2019;s body had never been found, so he didn&#x2019;t consider that he had anything holding him to his cloistered island town.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clive was thirty-five now. It was early April, and the clouds were clearing away after a morning rain. The air was so clean it almost burned his lungs. Clive had served seven out of his ten-year sentence in McNeill Island Penitentiary, and he was wearing his old court clothes: a dark blue suit his mother had bought him, now far too tight in his shoulders and upper arms. Feeling the sun cut through the trees, he set his cardboard box on the ground, slipped off the coat, folded it neatly, and set it on top of the box. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were only a few people getting off the prison boat, mostly staff members carrying lunch boxes and rain gear. There was one other inmate, a skinny white kid with red hair who walked down the dock to meet an old man waiting beside a sputtering Ford LTD. The convict approached, the man opened the passenger side door and a woman in a blue house dress got out and threw her arms around the boy before he could set his gear down on the ground. She cried and snuffled into his neck, while the old man rubbed the back of his shoulders.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clive shifted from one foot to another, waiting for his ride. A yellow minivan finally rolled up.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You Stilton Cheesewright?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clive was still watching the kid being greeted by the old couple. He wondered if he had seen the kid inside, but didn&#x2019;t recognize him. He hadn&#x2019;t recognize the false name the cabby was saying, either.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Stilton Cheesewright, yeah?&#x201d; the driver said again. He reached behind and opened the back door of the van.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Absolutely.&#x201d; Clive set his box of personal effects in the back seat, slammed the door, and walked around to sit in the front passenger seat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You want to go to a grocery store?&#x201d; He squinted at his run sheet.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Clive said. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s not too much trouble.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No problem, Mr. Cheesewright. Would you like me to wait while you shop?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Naw . . . just drop me. I might be a while,&#x201d; Clive said but then added: &#x201c;You know a place with really fresh lettuce?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The driver smiled. &#x201c;I think if you want the really fresh stuff you should go over to the Farmfresh store down Sixth. It&#x2019;s good, you know. They really do buy it from the farmers and everything. It&#x2019;s a couple of miles out of town, but it&#x2019;s worth it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Perfect,&#x201d; said Clive. The driver punched the meter and wheeled to his left, down the road away from the prison.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clive leaned back to watch the fence posts stutter by. He watched the sunlight filter through the evergreen trees and he watched a cow eating in a green field, a rusty bell hung from her neck. She lifted her head as the cab sped past and Clive could imagine the soft clonking of her bell wandering through the air. Clive asked to stop for a moment; the driver put on the turn signal and eased the van to the gravelly edge of the road. Clive thanked him, leaned back in the cab&#x2019;s mildewed seat, and smiled. He sat that way for a few moments, smiling and listening for the cow&#x2019;s bell. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You do a long stretch?&#x201d; the driver asked. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clive nodded, his eyes closed. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time to go home, I guess.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You want me to get going?&#x201d; the driver asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clive nodded again, his eyes still closed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go get you some lettuce then,&#x201d; the driver said and pulled the blinker all the way down, rolling the cab back onto the road.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clive was both happy and nervous. He had looked forward to this day with an urgency that few people who haven&#x2019;t been in prison could know. But just as it was happening he felt a kind of raw anxiety. He could not go back to crime, and although he had scrubbed his mind clean he knew that in this world of free men he understood little else besides crime. Crime was now, in his new state of mind, too chaotic.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McNeill was an old federal prison that had been remodeled as a medium security jail when it was turned over to the State of Washington. The Birdman of Alcatraz had actually done most of his time at McNeill. The main building had the original feel of the place: thick iron doors, WPA style murals on the walls of the mess hall. It could have been a large public library in some small Midwestern town if it weren&#x2019;t for all the sex offenders.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had seen arterial blood spurting and painting the shower floor red. He had seen the<br> black holes that hand made knives leave in young white skin. He had heard all the swearing that there was on the world and the blubbery threats made through spit stuffed lips. All he had wanted now was peace. No grittiness. He was done with it. He would always be a sinner, he knew that, but he could at least try not to sin as much. He had thought that even if he could cut back on his sinning by ten percent, that would still leave him plenty of room, while giving him a shot at some minor redemption at least.</p><h2>Don&#39;t Hold Me Back: My Life and Art</h2><p>Winfred Rembert grew up in the 1950s in rural Georgia as the child of sharecroppers whose lives were little better than slavery. As a young man, he was nearly lynched, and served seven years in jail and on a chain gang. Yet he constantly found ways to create, to invent, to uplift. As a child, he made toys from pieces of junk at the town dump. In prison, he watched a leather worker and learned to carve and paint the leather himself. Now, in his own voice and through his powerful paintings, he shares with a new generation of young people his story and his passionate commitment to self-improvement.<br>Reminiscent of the work of Jacob Lawrence and Horace Pippin, the paintings? rich, deep colors and poignant details powerfully narrate a story of personal courage and exceptional talent. At the same time, Rembert shows how the civil rights movement was not just a matter of famous speechs and marches, but was a product of the bonds of the black community and the unbreakable spirit of individuals</p><p>Grade 4 Up-Rembert grew up in the segregated rural South of the 1950s. His paintings visually chronicle this life, while his own words fill in where the pictures leave off. Although he did not begin painting until the 1990s, his memories are vividly portrayed in strong, confident works of art. From the cotton fields to Colored Folks Corner in Cuthbert, GA, to the county chain gang, Rembert depicts a hard life without bitterness. He also captures happier memories. The paintings are done in deep, warm, rich colors on leather. Shapes and colors create patterns that fill the art and draw the eye across the page. The white of the cotton bolls spread in waves across the field contrast sharply with the dark pigments of the pickers' skin tones. Black-and-white stripes of the chain gang literally cover the leather canvas. The reproductions fill the pages and details are enlarged within the discussion on subsequent pages. The result is a cohesive union of text and illustrations that reinforces the emotions, rhythm, and power of this autobiographical profile. The self-taught artist's powerful work is reminiscent of works by Jacob Lawrence and Horace Pippin. The title, which comes from Nikki Giovanni's poem for Winfred Rembert, is a theme that runs throughout the artist's life and his work. This book makes a strong companion to Belinda Rochelle's Words with Wings: A Treasury of African-American Poetry and Art (HarperCollins, 2001).-Carolyn Janssen, Children's Learning Center of the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, OH<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.*Starred Review* Gr. 4-7. This handsome book about the life and art of Winfred Rembert begins auspiciously with "Don't Hold Me Back," a poem written for the artist by Nikki Giovanni. In his autobiographical account, Rembert reflects on growing up in Georgia, picking cotton, worrying about lynching, attending a civil rights demonstration, spending time in prison. Telling the same story visually, Rembert's unusual pictures are classified as "outsider art." At first glance they look like naive paintings, but each one is a piece of leather that has been carved, tooled, and dyed with rich colors. Often a picture is discussed on a single double-page spread. In other cases, the discussion continues on a second spread, with portions of the original picture framed, enlarged, and presented again. This technique works very well, and so does the unusual practice of using a dark, monotone print of the featured picture as background for text. The book closes with a note on the art, a historical note, and a bibliography of recommended reading. This beautifully designed, very accessible book offers a vivid impression of an African American man's experiences in the mid-twentieth-century South. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Jesus continues to draw us closer to Him. He encourages trust in Him and to be focused on Him. Additionally, He gives us warning of things to come so that we may prepare ourselves spiritually by relying more and more on Jesus. Through the messages He provides understanding and divine calm to our souls. There are numerous messages from the saints including St. Therese, the Little Flower and St. Joan of Arc, among several others.

They cover a variety of spiritual topics including detachment, discouragement, trust in God, courage, duties in family life, and more. &#34;My dear earthly souls must fix their gaze on Me, much as a sailor will use the North Star to navigate his direction. If your gaze is fixed on Me, you will always be sailing towards heaven. There will be small diversions in your course, but generally you will be moving nearer.

You will be liberated without them. Now this is not to say you should wear no clothes and abandon your homes. I am not saying that.

Sent to work in a Dickensian factory, young Larten kills the abusive foreman and flees. He takes shelter in a cemetery crypt where he meets the 500-year-old vampire General Seba Nile, who explains to the terrified youngster that vampires aren&#39;t evil. Although they drink human blood, just as the legends say, they do not harm those on whom they feed. When he invites Larten to travel with him as his assistant, the boy agrees. As the first entry in a projected series, this story includes quite a bit of exposition. The plot action covers more than 20 years, taking Larten through his first &#34;blooding&#34; and into full vampire status, and features his first meetings with mysterious Cirque owner Hibernius Tall; Seba&#39;s vampire ally Paris Skyle; and the vampaneze Murlough. At times, the pacing feels rather rushed with the effort to introduce many important characters, settings, and themes from Shan&#39;s &#34;Cirque du Freak&#34; saga (Little, Brown).

Sightseers came to gaze at the horse advertised as &#34;Bonaparte&#39;s personal charger&#34;, whose career had spanned the whole of the Napoleonic Wars, who, to the sound of marching songs had trotted, cantered and galloped from the Mediterranean to Paris, Italy, Germany and Austria, and at the age of 19, had walked 3000 miles to Moscow and back. Since then, both dead and alive, this horse with the same sonorous name as Napoleon&#39;s great victory, Marengo, has been a star exhibit in Britain. At London&#39;s earliest military museum his articulated skeleton was seen by Queen Victoria and displayed as the horse that had carried his master at Austerlitz in 1805, at Jena in 1806, at Wagram in 1809, in the Russian Campaign of 1812, and at Waterloo in 1815. In telling the story of Marengo, Jill Hamilton shows an unexpected side to the Emperor. She explores Napoleon&#39;s enormous regard for horses as well as why it was Marengo, and Marengo alone, who became part of the Napoleonic legend - not Jaffa, Ali, Desiree or any of Napoleon&#39;s many mounts.</p><p>Jill Duchess of Hamilton, former newspaper journalist in both Australia and Fleet Street, she was born and educated in Sydney.

And Reinhart's subtitle introduces some amiable confusion, for whereas the author argues for the "slow rise" method as a general principle in developing "character" in a bread and crust and demonstrates its application in a fine recipe and procedure for "Sweet French Bread," more frequently he departs from it. The highly praised "Struan," for instance, a five-grain traditional Scottish "golden loaf" that "radiates in many directions," tolerates only two rather quick risings, character being born by "conditioners" such as buttermilk and polenta, rather than process. Brother Peter's wish to present a central principle for bread lets us in for a certain amount of New Age claptrap that is, however, well balanced by pragmatism. He makes insightful use of whole grains but has not a word to spare for unleavened breads. This book has much to say to the experienced baker, although the novice will find basics adequately covered. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Joy on Demand: The Art of Discovering the Happiness Within</h2><p><p><strong>Instant <em>New York Times</em> and <em>USA Today</em> Bestseller</strong></p><p>Joy is the root of happiness.</p><p>Joy is a sustainable state that fuels our creativity and inspiration for innovation.&nbsp; It strengthens our ability to attract friends and to get along with people.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning to&nbsp;cultivate joy is the fundamental secret to success.

The group was one of the most successful hip-hop groups of the late 1980s and, most importantly, started what the media quickly dubbed Gangsta Rap. His departure from N.W.A. was a story right out of a pulp fiction novel. His new mentor, Suge Knight, allegedly used guns, baseball bats and a kidnap threat to get Dr. Dre released from his contract. Dre and Knight went on to build Death Row Records and turned it into a multi-billlion dollar company. Yet despite its unprecedented success with stars such as Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur, the company quickly unraveled in a firestorm of rivalries, greed, violence, and scrutiny by both the government and the media. Not one to fade into the background, Dr. Dre&#39;s next move was to start his own record company, Aftermath Entertainment. As CEO, he discovered and created new stars like Eminem, 50 Cent, The Game, and Eve. In this essential addition to any music section, award-winning author Ronin Ro details the rise, fall, and resurrection of one of the biggest names in rap music.</p><p>Ronin Ro is an award-winning author and music journalist. He has written for <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Vibe</i>, <i>The Source</i>, <i>The Boston Herald</i>, <i>Spin</i>, <i>Playboy</i>, and <i>Rolling Stone</i>. He is the author of five other books, including the critically acclaimed <i>Have Gun Will Travel: The Spectacular Rise and Violent Fall of Death Row Records</i>.*Starred Review* Prolific rap chronicler Ro presents the most comprehensive treatment yet of a pivotal figure and founder of the rap industry. Dre has had a hand in nearly every development, feud, and trend since the early 1990s, when he and his seminal hip-hop aggregation N.W.A. (stands for Niggaz with Attitude, in case you've forgotten) emerged from Compton, California. He later managed, produced, or mentored superstars Busta Rhymes, Rakim, and 50 Cent and guaranteed platinum sellers Snoop Dog and Eminem. Ro uncovers a more reflective and introspective side of a man who has certainly seen it all, as far as the meteoric rise and contentious history of rap is concerned. In 1988, N.W.A. released <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, arguably the first gangsta rap album. Its provocative tracks brought radio bannings and public hand-wringing about the threat to society N.W.A., its songs, and its ilk represented. It made N.W.A. notorious and wealthy and led to the founding of Death Row Records, the East-West rap feud, and the gangland-style murders of rival rappers. Dre maintained a thoughtful composure. Probably one of the 10 best books on rap. <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The theory itself may be simple "Purpose opposed by Obstacle yields Conflict" but Cook takes his "Plottoist" through hundreds of situations and scenarios, guiding the reader&#x2019;s hand as a dizzying array of purposes and obstacles come to a head. Cook&#x2019;s method is broken down into three stages: First, the master plot. This four-page chart distills the most basic plot points into a three-line sentence. Next, the conflict situation. Each master plot leads the reader to a list of circumstances, distributed among 20 different conflict groups (these range from Love&#x2019;s Beginning&#x201d; to Personal Limitations&#x201d; to Transgression&#x201d;). There are over 2,000 unique conflict situations in the book, and each is cross-referenced with designs for how the situation might have started, or where it might go. Finally, there are character combinations Cook offers an extensive index of protagonists, each cross-referenced with various supporting players themselves tied to various conflict situations, for what appears to be an inexhaustible reservoir of suggestions and inspiration.</p><p>William Wallace Cook was born in Marshall, Michigan, in 1867. He was the author of a memoir, The Fiction Factory, as well as dozens of Westerns and science-fiction novels, many of which were adapted into films. He was nicknamed &#x201c;the man who deforested Canada&#x201d; for the volume of stories he fed into the pulp-magazine mill. He spent five years composing Plotto before finally publishing it in 1928.

With this volume spanning from her punk fanzine roots to her landmark piece on R. Kelly's past, <i>The First Collection</i> leaves no doubt why <i>The New York Times</i> has called Hopper's work "influential." Not merely a selection of two decades of Hopper's most engaging, thoughtful, and humorous writing, this book documents the last 20 years of American music making and the shifting landscape of music consumption. The book journeys through the truths of Riot Grrrl's empowering insurgence, decamps to Gary, IN, on the eve of Michael Jackson's death, explodes the grunge-era mythologies of Nirvana and Courtney Love, and examines emo's rise. Through this vast range of album reviews, essays, columns, interviews, and oral histories, Hopper chronicles what it is to be truly obsessed with music. The pieces in <i>The First Collection</i> send us digging deep into our record collections, searching to re-hear what we loved and hated, makes us reconsider the art, trash, and politics Hopper illuminates, helping us to make sense of what matters to us most.</p><p><b>Jessica Hopper</b> is a music and culture critic whose work regularly appears in <i>GQ, Rolling Stone, The Village Voice</i>, and the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>.

To commemorate the five-hundredth anniversary of the artist's birth, Oskar B�tschmann and Pascal Griener offer this richly illustrated book--the first comprehensive monograph on the artist to appear in more than forty years--which is a major advance in our understanding of Holbein's contribution to European art. The authors reexamine every aspect of a remarkable career, and further illuminate the artistic and cultural influences that affected the artist.</p><br><p> Holbein was a hugely ambitious artist, and even during his formative years in Lucerne and Basel, made designs for jewelry, stained glass, and woodcuts, and painted major altarpieces and portraits. He also carried out several monumental decorative schemes for private houses and civic buildings. In his commissions, Holbein sought to rival the greatest masters of Germany and Italy, most notably D�rer and Mantegna, and by the time of his visit to France in 1524 he was determined to secure a position as Court Painter. However, Holbein soon found himself in a precarious situation as a result of the Reformation's increasing hostility toward religious works, and he left for England in 1532. While in England, in addition to decorative schemes and Triumphs, he both drew and painted numerous unrivaled likenesses of leading courtiers, merchants, and diplomats, among which is his celebrated double portrait, <i>The Ambassadors</i>. This book offers both a remarkable range of extant visual evidence and a rewarding and scholarly account of Holbein's oeuvre in its full historical and artistic contexts.</p></p><p>This far-reaching study is the first comprehensive volume on Hans Holbein in 40 years. It is filled with color reproductions of the Renaissance artist's magnetic portraits, such as the well-loved rendering of the baby Edward, Prince of Wales, wielding his gold rattle like a scepter. Art historians will find the scholarship deep and subtle; all readers will enjoy stories such as the tale about Anne of Cleves, one of Henry VIII's prospective brides. Holbein enhanced her plain looks with regal robes of gold-encrusted velvet. The portrait persuaded Henry to propose; when Anne arrived, though, he called her a "fat Flanders mare." Holbein's reception at court turned chilly as a result: <i>sic transit gloria pictoris</i>.<b>Oskar B�tschmann</b> is Professor of Art History at the University of Bern.

But this was the summer of 1975, when the CIA was under investigation by Congress and unwilling to admit to any more transgressions, least of all its final ones in Vietnam. Unable to prompt even an official summary of the disastrous evacuation, Snepp resigned to write his own account in the hope of generating help for those abandoned, and spent the next eighteen months like a fugitive on the run, dodging CIA agents out to silence him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>His expose, Decent Interval, was published in total secrecy under conditions reminiscent of a classic espionage operation--the first time any American book had been brought out this way. But it ignited a firestorm of publicity that drove the CIA and Jimmy Carter's White House to launch a campaign of retaliation unparalleled in the annals of American law, a strategy of vengeance designed to leave Snepp impoverished and gagged for life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In struggling to survive, the onetime spy was forced to accept help from ACLU liberals, antiwar activists, and a fiery Harvard professor named Alan Dershowitz, whom he would previously have viewed as his ideological enemy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Snepp's harrowing firsthand account of his ordeals, from his shadowy trench battles with the Agency, to the destruction of his friends and family, to his historic showdown with the CIA in the courts, reads at times like Kafka's The Trial and at times like a John Grisham thriller, and recounts a tale of government persecution that will leave the reader wondering how any of this could have happened in America.</p><p>Former CIA spook Frank Snepp was one of the last Americans lifted off the U.S. embassy in Saigon in 1975, at the tail end of the Vietnam War. In the days leading up to that fateful moment, he complained that the United States needed to do more to protect its intelligence assets, most of whom were left behind. "We'd betrayed the Vietnamese who'd depended on us," writes Snepp in <i>Irreparable Harm</i>, "and those who worked most closely with them ... now had blood on our hands, for it was we who in our daily contacts had convinced them to trust us." Snepp criticized this turn of events in a 1977 book, <i>Decent Interval</i>, and was promptly sued by the CIA because they had not given him clearance to write about his experiences. The resulting court case went all the way to the Supreme Court. Snepp tried to defend himself on First Amendment grounds with the help of a then-unknown Harvard lawyer named Alan Dershowitz. He ultimately lost the case, plus his money and the right to publish anything about the CIA without first receiving authorization. <i>Irreparable Harm</i>--which <i>has</i> received CIA clearance--captures all the twists and turns of Snepp's legal fight, but even better, it casts light on the nature of bureaucracies and how they protect their turf. If you've ever wondered why there aren't more kiss-and-tell books written by onetime CIA agents, <i>Irreparable Harm</i> will show you why. <i>--John J. Miller</i>"A well written, candid, modern version of Kafka's <i>The Trial</i>."--James Bamford, <i>New York Times</i> <p>"Must reading for every law student in America. . . . Snepp took a courageous stand and paid for it. He, and the Constitution, deserved better."--Seymour Hersh, <i>Los Angeles Times</i> </p><p>"A hypnotizing and heart-breaking account [of] a constitutional train wreck."--Jeffrey Toobin, author of <i>A Vast Conspiracy</i> </p><p>"A powerfully written and richly biographical account."--David Garrow, <i>Washington Monthly</i> </p><p>"The First Amendment to the Constitution protects our right to say what we think, however unwelcome the message may be. And the 'central meaning of the First Amendment,' as the Supreme Court has put it, is the right to criticize government and its officials. So we believe. But the story of Frank Snepp mocks our belief. . . . A shocking revelation of how the law can be twisted in a country that prides itself on 'Equal Justice Under Law.'"--Anthony Lewis (from the Foreword) </p><p>"A reminder that cannot be repeated often enough of how government agencies hide their . . . malevolence and frequent Keystone Kop stupidities behind the tattered curtain of need-for-secrecy."--<i>Washington Post</i></p></p><h2>Weezer: (The Green Album)</h2><p>(Guitar Recorded Versions).

I wasn't one of those kids with a clear vision of the future, the ones who know at age five that they will be writers or doctors or artists. I liked to draw, but then, so did most of the kids I knew, and growing up to be an artist never really occurred to me. What I did want to be, in order of preference, was a magician, Davy Crockett, a doctor, a priest (until I found out they couldn't get married), and a downhill ski racer.</p><p>"But I always loved to make things, and once I got going on a project I loved, I stuck with it. Once, when I was five or six, I cut a thousand cloth feathers out of an old sheet, which I then attempted to glue to my bony little body. I was sure I could have flown off the back porch if I'd just had a better glue. Another time I dug up some smooth blue-gray clay from the field behind our house, then molded it into an entire zoo, dried the animals in the sun, and painted them as realistically as I could. I made a grotto out of cement, a shoe box, and my fossil collection. I made moccasins out of an old deerhide I found in the basement.</p><p>"I grew up in the little Wisconsin town of Kewaskum, the soul of which was the Milwaukee River. In the summer we rafted on it and swam in it. In the winter we skated on it, sometimes traveling miles upriver. In the spring and fall my dad took us on long canoe trips, silently sneaking up on deer, heron, and fields of a thousand Canada geese. And almost all year long we fished for bullheads and northerns from the dam.</p><p>"I began college at the University of Wisconsin as a biology major, but somewhere along the line--I'm not sure when or even why--I switched to art, and graduated with a bachelor of science degree in art. I still had no idea of becoming a professional artist, however. In the meantime, I joined VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) and moved to Bismarck, North Dakota, to work with United Tribes of North Dakota creating school curriculum materials. It was a great job. Because there were only a few of us, I was able to try my hand at a little of everything: writing, graphic design, photography, and illustration. It was then that I slowly realized that it might be possible for me to make a living at art. I moved to California, and in the evenings-after working all day as a carpenter's assistant--I put together a portfolio.</p><p>"Twenty years later, I'm still here, living in Santa Cruz with my wife, Toni, and our three sons, Mario, Jean-Paul, and Dominic. The Pacific Ocean is only a few blocks away, and the scenery is very different from that of the Midwest, but somehow Kewaskum and the Milwaukee River show up in almost everything I draw. They provided the details of setting for <em>The Rainbabies, Carousel,</em> and <em>Grandmother's Pigeon,</em> and they are the setting for the book I'm working on now, my own story about the magic of a raft.</p><p>"I feel very lucky to have ended up as an illustrator of children's books. And maybe that isn't so different from my childhood dream of being a magician after all. Starting with a clean sheet of paper and with nothing up my sleeves, I get to create something that was never there before."</p>Grade 4-6-It is somewhat startling that Rylant should choose to cover a period of time about which Wilder herself chose not to write. Here the Ingalls leave their farm on the banks of Plum Creek to spend several years in Burr Oak, IA. Pa's determination is tested, but his pioneering spirit and hard work coupled with Ma's essential support and unending labor see them through. The death of a new baby who arrives at the opening of the novel is clearly painful to all; a birth near its closure is a reminder that life goes on. After several different homes in Iowa, the family returns to Plum Creek, where Wilder continued the story in By the Shores of Silver Lake (HarperCollins, 1953). LaMarche's illustrations wisely focus more on things than on people, which helps to reduce their incongruity with Garth Williams's drawings. The characters are somewhat different here. Laura seems less of a tomboy and enjoys tea parties and talking about the dolls and rich furnishings of their small-town neighbors. Some of the events match quite closely with known biographical details, while others are definitely fictionalized. Rylant enjoys detailed descriptions of the flora and fauna much more than the original narrator. These small differences will not matter a whit to those insatiable for further Laura stories. For purists who want the classics left alone and are sure Wilder is rolling in her grave, the whole idea is strictly sacrilege. For most everyone else, this is neither a necessary nor valuable addition.<br><i>Carol A.
